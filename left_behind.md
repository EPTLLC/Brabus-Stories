# Left Behind

Morning light poured through cracks in the curtains, fell in stripes on the floor. The house was quiet, only somewhere in the wall a clock ticked. She entered without removing her coat, put her bag by the threshold. The door behind closed with a soft click.

The living room smelled of dust and something sweet, forgotten. On the table stood a cup, half-drunk, with brown sediment at the bottom. Nearby - a book, open in the middle, the corner of a yellowish page bent. She passed by without looking, but her fingers on the bag clenched.

The kitchen met her with cold. The sink was empty, no plates, no crumbs. On the windowsill - a pot with basil, leaves withered, earth cracked. She reached for the faucet but stopped. She took a sponge, dry and hard, ran it across the countertop. Dust gathered in a gray lump. The sponge fell back.

In the hallway - a pair of boots by the wall. One slightly tilted, laces untied. She stepped over them but stumbled on the rug, that same one with the worn pattern. The rug remained lying, crumpled.

The bedroom was untouched. The bed was made, but the pillow on one side was dented, as if someone had just gotten up. On the nightstand - glasses, folded neatly, lenses dusty. She opened the closet. Hangers clinked, empty, but one shirt hung, wrinkled, with a coffee stain on the cuff. The closet door remained open.

She returned to the living room, sat on the sofa. Springs creaked. On the armrest - a wool blanket, rolled unevenly, the corner hanging to the floor. She didn't straighten it. Just sat, looking at the light stripes crawling across the room. The clock ticked, but the hands seemed not to move.

In the bag by the threshold something clinked - keys, coins, doesn't matter. She ignored it. She stood, approached the window, pulled apart the curtains. Light rushed in, sharp, blinding. Outside - the street, wet from recent rain, and the neighbor's dog lazily wandering along the fence. She looked but didn't see.

Back to the table. The book was still there. She took it, ran her finger along the bent page. The paper was rough, slightly yellowed. She closed the book, put it in place. Didn't touch the cup.

The door creaked when she left. She left the bag by the threshold. The lock clicked, and her steps faded on the porch.

She descended from the porch without looking back. Rain had left puddles on the sidewalk, and her shoes got wet, but she felt nothing. The street was empty, only the neighbor's dog barked in the distance. She reached the corner where they used to turn to the park together. She stopped. The wind brought the smell of wet grass, and for a second it seemed he was nearby, walking slightly ahead, as always. But the sidewalk was empty. She adjusted her coat collar and kept walking, nowhere in mind, everywhere in loss.
