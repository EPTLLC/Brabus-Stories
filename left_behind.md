# Left Behind

Morning light poured through gaps in the curtains, falling in stripes across the floor. The house was quiet. Only a clock ticked somewhere in the wall.

She entered without taking off her coat. Set her bag by the door. The door closed behind her with a soft click.

---

The living room smelled of dust and something sweet, forgotten.

On the table-a cup, half-finished, with brown residue at the bottom. Beside it-a book, open in the middle, corner of the page folded down.

She walked past without looking. But her fingers tightened on the bag strap.

---

The kitchen greeted her with cold.

The sink was empty. No dishes, no crumbs. On the windowsill-a pot of basil, leaves withered, soil cracked.

She reached for the faucet, then stopped. Picked up a sponge-dry, stiff-ran it across the counter. Dust gathered into a gray clump.

The sponge fell back.

---

In the hallway-a pair of boots by the wall. One tilted slightly, laces untied.

She stepped over them but stumbled on the rug-that same one, with the worn pattern.

The rug stayed crumpled.

---

The bedroom was untouched.

Bed made, but the pillow on one side was dented, as if someone had just gotten up. On the nightstand-glasses, folded neatly, lenses dusty.

She opened the closet.

Hangers clinked-empty. But one shirt hung there, wrinkled, with a coffee stain on the cuff.

And the smell.

His smell-barely there, almost dissolved into the dust. But it was here. Still here.

She stood motionless until the scent faded completely. Then closed the door.

---

She returned to the living room. Sat on the couch. Springs creaked.

On the armrest-a wool blanket, unevenly folded, corner hanging to the floor.

She didn't straighten it.

Just sat, watching the stripes of light crawl across the room. The clock ticked. The hands didn't seem to move.

---

She stood. Walked to the window. Pulled the curtains apart.

Light flooded in-sharp, blinding. Outside-the street, wet from recent rain. The neighbor's dog ambled lazily along the fence.

She looked but didn't see.

---

Back to the table.

The book still there. She picked it up, ran her finger along the folded page. Paper rough, slightly yellowed.

Closed the book. Put it back.

Didn't touch the cup.

---

The door creaked as she left.

The bag stayed by the threshold.

The lock clicked. Footsteps faded on the porch.

---

She walked down without looking back.

Rain had left puddles on the sidewalk. Her shoes got wet, but she didn't notice.

The street was empty. Only the neighbor's dog barked in the distance.

She reached the corner where they used to turn together toward the park.

Stopped.

The wind brought the smell of wet grass, and for a second she thought-he was there, walking just ahead, like always.

But the sidewalk was empty.

She adjusted her coat collar and walked on.

Not knowing where.
