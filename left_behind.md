# Left Behind

Morning light poured through cracks in curtains, fell in stripes on floor. House was quiet, only somewhere in wall clock ticked. She entered without removing coat, put bag by threshold. Door behind closed with soft click.

Living room smelled of dust and something sweet, forgotten. On table stood cup, half-drunk, with brown sediment at bottom. Nearby - book, open in middle, corner of yellowish page bent. She passed by without looking, but fingers on bag clenched.

Kitchen met with cold. Sink empty, no plates, no crumbs. On windowsill - pot with basil, leaves withered, earth cracked. She reached for faucet but stopped. Took sponge, dry, hard, ran across countertop. Dust gathered in gray lump. Sponge fell back.

In hallway - pair of boots by wall. One slightly tilted, laces untied. She stepped over them but stumbled on rug, that same one with worn pattern. Rug remained lying, crumpled.

Bedroom was untouched. Bed made, but pillow on one side dented, as if someone just got up. On nightstand - glasses, folded neatly, lenses dusty. She opened closet. Hangers clinked, empty, but one shirt hung, wrinkled, with coffee stain on cuff. Closet door remained open.

She returned to living room, sat on sofa. Springs creaked. On armrest - wool blanket, rolled unevenly, corner hanging to floor. She didn't straighten it. Just sat, looking at light stripes crawling across room. Clock ticked, but hands seemed not to move.

In bag by threshold something clinked - keys, coins, doesn't matter. She ignored it. Stood, approached window, pulled apart curtains. Light rushed in, sharp, blinding. Outside - street, wet from recent rain, and neighbor's dog lazily wandering along fence. She looked but didn't see.

Back to table. Book still there. She took it, ran finger along bent page. Paper rough, slightly yellowed. Closed book, put in place. Didn't touch cup.

Door creaked when she left. Left bag by threshold. Lock clicked, and her steps faded on porch.

She descended from porch without looking back. Rain left puddles on sidewalk, and her shoes got wet, but she felt nothing. Street was empty, only neighbor's dog barked in distance. She reached corner where they used to turn to park together. Stopped. Wind brought smell of wet grass, and for second it seemed he was nearby, walking slightly ahead, as always. But sidewalk was empty. She adjusted coat collar and kept walking, nowhere in mind, everywhere in loss.
