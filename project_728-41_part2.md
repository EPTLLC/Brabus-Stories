# Project 728-41: Part II — The Middle Ages

The porthole is cold beneath my fingers. Below—the same planet. Third from a yellow dwarf. Different clouds. Continents shifted slightly. Details.

Object 728-41. Two million orbits ago, I watched them throw stones at me. The stones crumbled to ash, yet they didn't retreat. I remember the child's gaze by the fire—dark eyes, flames within them. Something I hadn't coded.

I close my eyes. Memory throws up an image—smoke, roasting meat, monotonous chanting from a stone building. Another descent. Them again.

My age is four billion Earth years. My Homeland is a billion light-years from here. In my skull—quantum-neural nodes, every nanosecond recorded, any frame accessible instantly. Except one. Five embedded superintelligences remember all ten billion years of our race. From the first photosynthesizing division to the present day.

But I don't want to remember everything. Memory is not a gift. It's a burden.

Coordinates: 43°46′ N, 11°15′ E.

The peninsula they will call Italy. Tuscany. The year by their calendar—1348.

The ramp touches ground, and the smell hits first. Not grass, not dust. Rot. Sweet, heavy. Air: same oxygen, same nitrogen. But something in it has changed.

They are dying.

Massively. Quickly. Without logic they can understand. Yersinia pestis—I know the name they'll give it six hundred years from now. Now they call it "God's wrath."

God. Their operating system. A protocol that explains the inexplicable.

My civilization stopped believing in the supernatural so long ago that I don't remember it myself. Somewhere in the depths of the fourth or fifth embedded mind, there's a record of that too—of the time when we also sought answers in the sky. I won't access them. Not now.

I descend to observe.

---

The monastery stands on a hill, surrounded by walls of yellow stone. Inside—a laboratory. They call it an "abbey." Same function: isolation, control, data extraction.

Monks walk slowly, in black robes. Lips moving—a protocol for addressing the central server. Prayer. They repeat the same words, again and again. Frequency—roughly every three hours. Efficiency—zero. They continue.

I observe for three weeks.

The plague approaches the walls. The village below empties. Bodies are burned—by those who can still stand. Smoke rises to the sky, and monks watch it through narrow windows.

Their faith hasn't wavered. This irritates me.

---

I enter in the guise of a pilgrim. Torn clothes, a staff, dirt on my face. They accept me. Give me bread, water, a place by the wall.

The bread is hard, with a taste of ash. I eat. Register the texture—dense, crumbling. Register the taste—sour, with a note of smoke. Don't register pleasure.

We can process any organic matter, but on the Homeland we've long used nutrient solutions—more efficient. I remember the shashlik from Sivatherium. Two million orbits ago. Then I enjoyed it.

Now—no.

The abbot—an old man with sunken eyes—looks at me.

"Where do you come from, brother?"

"From far away."

"We all come from far away. We all walk toward Him."

Protocol. Standard response. I nod.

He looks longer than he should. Then turns away.

---

On the seventh day, they bring the heretic.

Young. About twenty-five by their count. Hands bound, a rope around his neck. Two soldiers lead him. Behind them—a man in white. The Inquisitor.

The heretic denied the resurrection. Said the body is just a body. That the soul is a fiction. That after death—nothing.

He's right. By all metrics. But this is a deviation from the model.

They will burn him tomorrow at dawn.

I watch as they lead him to the cellar. He doesn't scream. Doesn't beg. Looks straight ahead. Eyes—empty. Or not. Something in them. Not fear. Not resignation.

Calculation?

No. Something else.

---

Night.

I stand by the wall, looking at the stars. The same stars as two million years ago. The same as they'll be in two million more. They don't change. People—change.

On the Homeland, the sky is violet. Three suns, no moons. Silence—absolute, because we long ago stopped speaking aloud. Here—noise. Wind, crickets, someone's breathing behind the wall. Chaos. They live in chaos and don't notice it.

Footsteps behind me.

A monk. Young, about thirty. Face pale, hands trembling. He carries something under his robe.

I don't move. He passes by, not noticing me. Or pretending not to.

He goes toward the cellar.

I follow.

---

He opens the door with a key he shouldn't have. Descends the steps. I—behind him, in the shadows.

The heretic sits in the corner, chained to the wall. Raises his head.

The monk kneels. Takes bread from under his robe. Water. Extends them.

"Eat. Quickly."

The heretic looks at him.

"Why?"

"I don't know."

Silence.

"You're breaking the rules," the heretic says. "They'll burn you beside me."

"I know."

"Then why?"

The monk is silent. Hands still trembling. Then he speaks—quietly, almost a whisper:

"Because you're right. And because it doesn't matter."

I stand in the darkness. Not breathing. Not moving.

The heretic takes the bread. Eats. Slowly. The monk watches.

"I can't save you," the monk says. "But I can... this."

"This is nothing."

"This is all I have."

They are silent. Then the monk stands. Leaves. The door closes.

I stand in the darkness for a long time.

---

In the morning, they burn the heretic.

He doesn't scream. Looks at the sky until smoke covers his eyes.

The monk stands in the crowd. Face—stone. Lips moving. Prayer? No. Something else.

I read his lips.

"Forgive."

Who is he speaking to? The heretic? God? Himself?

Cannot classify.

---

I leave that same day.

On the hill, beyond the monastery walls, I turn back. Smoke still rises. Monks are singing. The plague crawls toward the gates.

The monk broke the rules. Broke the doctrine. Broke everything he believed in.

For a man who denied his faith.

This doesn't fit any model. None.

Two million orbits ago, an old man struck my force field with a spear. Thirty times. Knew it was useless. Struck anyway. I recorded it as "irrational resistance."

Now I understand: it was the same thing. Bread in an outstretched hand. A spear striking emptiness. They do what makes no sense. And that—is the only thing that makes sense.

Faith—an operating system. Effective. Stable. I underestimated it.

But this glitch—isn't faith. It's something else. Something that works against the system. Within the system. Against the system.

I return to the ship. Rise to orbit. Look at the planet from above.

Blue. White streaks of clouds. Smoke over Tuscany—a barely visible dot.

I can pull any frame from memory. Trillions of nanoseconds.

But I pull only one.

The monk on his knees. Bread in an outstretched hand. Trembling fingers.

"This is all I have."

I knew the answer. I just didn't want to hear it.

---

In the archives—one line.

"Object 728-41 (Europe, 1348). Yersinia pestis epidemic. Mortality—47%. Social structures—partial collapse. Religious system—stable. Anomaly: recorded act of irrational mercy outside faith protocol. Status: requires analysis."

One line. Twenty-five million dead. One monk with a piece of bread.

One line.

---

I approach the porthole. Glass cold beneath my fingers. Below—blue planet, white streaks of clouds. The smoke over Tuscany has long dispersed.

But I smell it. Sweet. Heavy. Rot.

Here, on the ship, in sterile air filtered to the last molecule.

I smell it.

Cannot turn away.
