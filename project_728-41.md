# Project 728-41

![Project 728-41](images/project_728-41.jpg)

The viewport is cold beneath my fingers. Below — a blue planet, third from a yellow dwarf. I've seen thousands like it. This one was no different. Then.

I close my eyes. Memory obligingly throws up a frame — the smell of acacia smoke, fat crackling on coals. Two and a half million orbits ago. Or yesterday. For me, there's no difference.

Four billion Earth years. A billion light-years from here. In my skull — quantum-neural nodes, every nanosecond recorded, any frame accessible instantly. Five embedded superintelligences remember all ten billion years of our species. From the first photosynthesizing division to this very day.

But I don't want to remember everything. Memory is not a gift. It's a burden.

Coordinates: 3°50′ N, 37°10′ E.

Future Lake Turkana region. East African Rift. The ramp touches ground, and heat strikes my face — dry, dusty, with a taste of grass. Air: 20.9% oxygen, 78% nitrogen. Perfect for us.

The crew sets up camp. One of ours shot a three-horned Sivatherium. A ton and a half of meat. The carcass falls, raising a cloud of dust. I stand, watch them butcher it. The crew's hands bloody to the elbows. The smell — iron and grass.

Kebab ready in forty minutes. Acacia smoke stings the eyes. Fat drips onto coals, hisses. Someone laughs. I bite off a piece, hot, with a crispy crust. Juice runs down my chin. I wipe it with the back of my hand.

Perfect doneness.

---

Over eleven local days we cover the rift valley and the proto-Red Sea coast.

Heat presses down. Dust grinds between teeth, works into skin folds. Boots sink into dry earth, leaving tracks the wind erases within minutes.

Scanners detect 43 groups. Total count — around two thousand individuals. Brain volume 900–1100 cm³. Already tools. Fire — in some groups.

We find the first group by a river. We spotted smoke from their fire three kilometers away.

A male notices us first. Freezes. Nostrils flare — sniffing. Hand slowly reaches for a stone. Eyes — wary, but not empty. Not prey-fear before a predator. Something else. Calculation.

We approach. He doesn't run. Raises the stone. Bares teeth. Makes a sound — low, guttural. A warning. Behind him, females grab infants, drag them toward trees. Other males stand beside the first. Shoulder to shoulder. Stones in hand.

We could put them down instantly. But protocol requires testing in natural state.

I take a step. He throws the stone. It hits the force field. The stone flares, crumbles to ash. He freezes. Looks at his hand. At me. At his hand again. Doesn't understand. But doesn't retreat. Takes a second stone.

We wait. An hour. Two. The sun crawls across the sky. They don't leave. Don't attack. Just stand. A wall of bodies, stones, and bared teeth.

Pointless. But they stand.

When the sun touches the horizon, we activate paralyzers. They fall — all at once, like puppets with cut strings. Silence. Only wind and the crackle of a dying fire.

---

Eleven days. 43 groups. The same scenario.

We appear. They form a wall. Throw stones, sticks, burning branches. Scream. Bare teeth. Females try to carry off infants, males cover the retreat. Sometimes — they attack. One old male rushed me with a sharpened bone, aiming for my eye apparently. The bone shattered against the field, he was jolted and thrown three meters. He got up. Rushed again. And again. Until he lost consciousness.

They cannot harm us. They understand this — after the first stone crumbles to ash. But they don't stop.

We run tests on site while they're paralyzed. Scan brains. Check reflexes. Take tissue samples. They feel nothing, but their eyes — open. Watching. One male — I saw a tear roll down his cheek. Not from pain. From what, then?

Mirror test — after waking, in isolation. Most — aggression, attack the reflection. But some freeze. Touch their face. Look at the hand in the mirror, then at their own. One — young, with a scar on his forehead — stares into his own eyes for a long time. Then turns away. As if he saw something he didn't want to see.

Action sequencing. We demonstrate: stone, stick, nut. Break it. A third repeat on the first try. Some more — on the second or third.

Social learning. A holographic projection shows how to make a loop from a vine. They watch. Silent. Then — almost all try. Clumsy, awkward, but they try.

From two thousand we select 714. 357 males, 357 females. Best results across all tests. The rest — we release. They'll wake and remember nothing.

---

Loading.

714 individuals. Force fields hold them motionless — arms at sides, legs together. They cannot move. But they can watch. And they watch.

The first male — the one who threw stones by the river — hangs in the field, muscles strained to the limit. I see veins bulging on his neck, jaw trembling. He tries to move. Every second. Cannot. But tries. In his eyes — not fear. Rage. Pure, concentrated.

We could switch off their consciousness. Would be simpler. More humane, if that word applies.

But protocol requires observation of stress response.

The females are silent. Most. But one — with an infant in the field beside her — makes a sound. Quiet, monotonous. Not a scream. Not crying. Something else. I run the sound through the analyzer. Rhythmic structure. Repeating pattern. She's singing. Singing to her child, whom she cannot embrace, cannot protect, cannot even turn her head toward.

The infant stares at the ceiling. Eyes dry. Not crying. Listening.

One female — young, with a light stripe across her face — hangs motionless. Doesn't strain her muscles. Doesn't try to break free. Just looks at me. Eyes — black, wet. No hatred. No fear. As if she's already understood something the rest won't grasp for millions of years.

I look away first.

We depart. Island-laboratory: 28,000 km² of land, ocean level 120 meters lower. Back then it was a real island. A prison with no escape. Not that they had anywhere to escape to.

---

First round of edits.

The laboratory hums. Light — cold, blue. On the table — tissue samples, test tubes, holographic DNA models rotating in the air.

FOXP2 — replacement of two amino acids, positions 303 and 325. Foundation of future syntax. I enter the command, watch the helix restructure. Click. Done.

SRGAP2C — duplication and insertion. Slowing dendrite maturation. Extending childhood. More time to learn. More plasticity.

MCPH1, ASPM — accelerated alleles. Neocortex growth.

HAR1, HAR2 — accelerating prefrontal cortex development.

Dozens of minor adjustments. Immune system. Metabolism. So they survive.

We work carefully. Like sculptors. Or like butchers. Depends on who's watching.

---

Then — the schedule.

Every 8–12 Earth years the ship returns. I descend the ramp, and heat strikes my face again. Same smell — dust, grass, smoke.

They're already waiting. Not with joy — with spears. Every time. Every generation. They pass down the story of those who come from the sky and take the best. To them we are demons. Spirits. A curse.

They hide children. Post sentries. Dig pit traps on paths to the camp — useless, we see them from orbit. Coat spears with poison — it doesn't penetrate the field. Set ambushes — we detect their body heat with peripheral vision.

Once — this was a hundred twenty thousand years after the start — they tried something new. Thirty males smeared themselves with mud, lay in pits all night, cooled to ground temperature. Scanners didn't see them. When I walked toward the village — they rose. Silent. Spears pointed at me.

I stopped. Looked at them. They looked at me.

One — the elder, gray, scars across his chest — stepped forward. Raised his spear. Struck. The point flared and crumbled to ash. He didn't retreat. Took a spear from the one beside him. Struck again. Ash. Again. Ash.

The others watched. Didn't move. Waited.

He struck until the spears ran out. Then stood, breathing hard, hands empty. Looked at me. I saw in his eyes — he knew from the start. Knew he wouldn't break through. Knew it was pointless.

But he rose from that pit anyway. Struck anyway. Thirty times. Like the one who rushed me with a bone, aiming for my eye, when we took the first group.

I activated the paralyzer. They fell. We took biopsies. Ran tests. Left.

But I remember his eyes. Not rage. Not fear. Something else. Decision. He chose to resist, knowing he would lose. This wasn't instinct. This was choice.

I stopped counting generations. They were born. Loved. Hated. Died. We returned. More tests. More edits. Left again. Every time — resistance. They never surrendered. Never.

Eight hundred thousand years ago — the intermediate line. You'll call it Homo heidelbergensis. Larger brain. More complex tools. Fire — everywhere.

Three hundred thousand years ago — final release. Brain 1410 cm³. Full brain-language-brain synchronization. First symbols. First drawings on stones. First graves.

They started burying their dead. I stood on a hill, watched them lower a body into a pit, place flowers beside it. Flowers. Why? In our civilization, before we stopped dying, we understood this. These ones — no. The dead don't care.

But they placed them anyway.

---

Last intervention — 74 thousand years ago.

Toba. Eruption. Ash blocked the sky for years. Temperature dropped. Population fell to three thousand individuals. Three thousand. From millions.

We provided backup. Light upgrade to mitochondrial line L0-L3. Y-chromosomal haplogroup A00-A1. Final touch.

Since then — only observation.

Only observation.

---

Once — I don't remember which visit — I descended alone.

Night. Sky black, stars bright as never on our worlds. Air cold, smelling of smoke and something sweet — maybe flowers, maybe rotting fruit.

They sat around a fire. About twenty. Fire crackled, sparks flew upward. Someone was speaking — already words, real words, I understood every third one.

A female sat at the edge. Held an infant. Stroked his head — slowly, rhythmically. The infant watched the fire. Flames reflected in his eyes.

I stepped closer. A branch snapped under my foot.

The infant raised his head. Saw me.

Didn't scream. Didn't run. Didn't call for his mother.

Just watched.

Eyes dark, wet. Fire in them. And something else. Something I didn't code. Something that wasn't in our edits. Something that shouldn't have been there.

I stood.

He watched.

The female pulled him closer, but he didn't look away. I felt his gaze on me — like a touch, like a burn.

How long did I stand? A minute? An hour? I don't know. Time stopped. For the first time in four billion years.

Then I left. Returned to the ship. Didn't record it in the report.

Why? It changed nothing.

---

In the archives — one line.

"Object 728-41. Source material — local bipeds, brain 900–1100 cm³. Cultivation time — 2,502,813 local orbits. Result — autonomous sentient civilization, species self-designation Homo sapiens. Status: observation continues."

One line. Two and a half million years. Thousands of generations. Billions of lives.

One line.

---

I open my eyes. The viewport still cold beneath my fingers. The planet below — blue, with white streaks of clouds. They're down there. Building. Destroying. Loving. Killing. Burying their dead and placing flowers.

I can pull any frame from memory. Trillions of nanoseconds. Everything recorded.

But I pull only one.

Night. Fire. An infant in his mother's arms. Eyes — dark, wet. Fire in them. And something else.

Can't erase it. Don't want to erase it.

Four billion years. Trillions of frames. And I remember — him.

The smell of acacia smoke. Fat crackling on coals. Juice running down my chin.

Perfect doneness.

Or not.

I look at the planet. They're down there. Object 728-41. Project. Experiment.

But he looked at me. And I don't know who created whom.
