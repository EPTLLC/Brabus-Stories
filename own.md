# We Don't Leave Our Own

---

Psychiatric hospital. Closed geriatric ward. Third floor. Bars on the windows. The smell of bleach, urine, and something sour you get used to by the second day.

Ward 7. Bed by the window. An old man.

In his chart - age, diagnosis, number. No one remembers his name. Staff call him "seven" or "the violent one." No relatives. No visitors. Just screams at night and bruises on the nurses.

They fear him. They hate him. They tie him down.

---

Dima started three weeks ago. Contract serviceman. Medically discharged. Shoulder doesn't work right. Head - same.

Never talked about the war. Never took off his dog tag.

At the interview they asked: criminal record? No. Work experience? No. Ready for night shifts? Yes.

Hired - first place in four months that didn't ask about the war.

Pay is shit. Work is shit. Literally. Wash, feed, turn over. Those who were dumped and forgotten. Those who aren't people anymore - that's what the other orderlies say. Dima stays quiet.

He's not sure he's still human either.

---

First time in ward seven was on day four.

- Violent one in there. Be careful.

Dima walked in. The old man lay facing the wall. Thin. Grey. Arms along his body - covered in old scars, many.

Dima approached. Put a hand on his shoulder.

The old man spun - and struck. Fast. Precise. At the throat.

Dima slipped it. Reflex.

The old man stared at him. Eyes empty - but body in stance.

Dima walked out. Sat in the corridor. Lit a cigarette, though it wasn't allowed.

---

Next day he asked for ward seven himself.

- You crazy? - the head nurse asked.

- Maybe.

She shrugged. One more psycho, one less - doesn't affect her pay.

---

First week - failures.

Dima tried talking - the old man didn't hear. Tried silence - the old man hit. Tried approaching slowly - the old man hit faster.

Then he understood. Not words. Not speed. Direction.

From behind - enemy. From the side - threat. From the front, slowly, with voice - possible.

---

Dima stopped at the door. Exhaled. Step forward. Stopped. Exhaled.

Only then walked in.

The old man lay the same way. Facing the wall.

- Coming in from the right. Friendly, - Dima said quietly.

The old man didn't turn. But his shoulder relaxed slightly.

Dima approached. Set down the tray. Sat on the chair. Didn't touch.

After a minute the old man turned. Looked. Didn't hit.

Dima nodded. Got up. Left.

---

That's how it went.

Every time - stop at the door. Exhale. Step. Stop. Exhale. Voice: coming in from the right, friendly. Coming in from the left, friendly. Going to lift you now. Injection now.

The old man hit others. Not Dima. Almost.

Once Dima came from the wrong side - took an elbow to the cheekbone. His own fault.

The head nurse asked: what happened to your face?

- Fell.

She didn't believe him. But didn't ask again.

---

The other orderlies didn't understand.

- Why bother with him? Just tie him down.

Dima didn't answer. Didn't know the answer himself. Only knew - there, in those empty eyes, something was there. Something he recognized.

The old man scanned the room - every time. Window, door, corners. Even when his eyes were clouded. Put up blocks in his sleep - arms rising instinctively. Screamed at night. Words. Commands. Call signs.

---

A month passed. Or two.

The old man grew quieter. With him - only with him. Still hit the others. But let Dima in. Sometimes even looked at him.

Sometimes - drool on his chin. Trembling hands. Wet pants. The smell. Dima wiped, changed, stayed silent. The old man stared at the ceiling and moved his lips. Something childish, incoherent. Then - emptiness again.

One night Dima came to check. The old man wasn't sleeping. Sitting on the bed. Looking out the window. Lips moving.

Dima came closer. Listened.

Names. One after another. Quietly. Like roll call.

Then the old man went silent. Turned. Looked at Dima.

Eyes - clear. For the first time.

- Hold on. We don't leave our own.

Dima had heard this before. Different voice. Different night. The one he carried until his strength gave out.

And again - emptiness. The gaze faded. The old man lay down. Turned to the wall.

Dima stood in the corridor. Couldn't move.

---

A week later the old man died.

At night. Quietly.

Dima found out in the morning. Bed empty. Sheets stripped.

- Seven's done, - the nurse said. - Finally.

Dima clenched his fist in his pocket. Said nothing.

---

In the bedside table they found a dog tag. Old. Worn. Letters barely readable.

The head nurse wanted to throw it away.

- I'll take it, - Dima said.

- Why?

He said nothing. She handed it over.

---

That evening Dima stepped out onto the porch.

Exhaled. Took a step.

Took out a cigarette. Didn't light it.

Two dog tags clinked against each other.

*He left hard. But not in vain.*
