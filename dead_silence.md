# Dead Silence

He walked along the path where just yesterday grass whispered in the wind, brushing his boots with soft fingers. Now it lay flattened, black with soot, as if the earth itself had suffocated.

The air was heavy, soaked with smoke and something acrid—like the echo of a distant scream. His footsteps crunched on charred branches, and every sound tore through the silence, too loud in this dead world.

He adjusted the strap of his bag. Inside—a crust of bread and a letter. A letter for Mara. He had carried it for three days.

He imagined her laugh—loud, like a bell. Eyes squinting in the sun. But there was no sun. The sky pressed down gray, and something cold and sharp grew in his chest, like a shard of glass.

---

The village lay ahead.

He had known it since childhood: crooked roofs, smoke from chimneys, laughter from behind fences. On summer evenings Mara would braid a crown of grass for him, laughing that he was now "king of the meadow." Old Yon would treat everyone to sour wine. The freckled boy would steal apples and run between houses until someone caught him by the ear.

Now there was neither smoke nor laughter.

Only wind driving dust down the empty road. Somewhere in the distance a shutter creaked, beating against a wall—like a heart that refuses to stop.

---

He stopped at the first house.

The door hung on one hinge, as if someone had clung to it until the very end. Inside—shadows, shards of dishes, an overturned bench. On the table sat a bowl of porridge covered with gray film, as if forgotten forever.

On the wall—a burned mark. A circle with three lines, like claws.

His heart clenched. He didn't know what it was. But he felt: this wasn't just fire.

He didn't call out. His voice would have drowned in this silence, like a stone in a swamp.

---

In the square, where people once sang and danced, now lay the wreckage of a cart, scraps of cloth. Something that might have been clothing. Or not clothing.

He looked away.

His eyes searched for something familiar—a face, a voice, a trace. But found only hoofprints pressed into mud, and long furrows, as if someone had dragged something heavy. Or someone.

He gripped the bag strap until his fingers went white.

"Mara," he whispered to himself. "Where are you?"

---

Her house stood at the edge of the village. The porch where she read his letters, face turned to the sun. "You write like old Yon talks," she would tease. "All about the road and the stars."

The porch was empty. The door—wide open. Inside—the same chaos: overturned table, broken window, ash on the floor.

He stood on the threshold, not daring to enter.

Then he entered.

On the floor, by the stove, lay an envelope. He picked it up. His hands trembled.

On the envelope—his name. Her handwriting. Letters slightly uneven, as if she had been hurrying. The envelope itself was strangely clean amid the soot and debris—as if she had just set it down, meaning to finish writing.

He opened the envelope.

Empty.

Nothing. Not a word. She had prepared it but didn't have time to write. She had thought of him. Wanted to reply. Didn't make it.

He stood holding the empty envelope, and the silence pressed on his shoulders like a stone slab.

---

He walked out to the square.

Sat on a stone—still warm, as if holding someone's warmth. On the fence across hung a child's mitten, burned on one edge. It swayed in the wind, as if waving goodbye.

He closed his eyes.

Faces flickered before him: Mara, old Yon, the freckled boy. He wanted to scream, to call them. But something inside whispered: they're gone. They're gone now.

The silence wrapped around him like a shroud. He felt it seeping into him, filling the emptiness where hope and warmth once lived.

---

He stood up.

Took his letter from the bag—folded in four, crumpled from the journey. Placed it on the stone. Weighed it down with a shard of roof tile so the wind wouldn't carry it away.

A letter she would never read.

The envelope—her envelope, empty, with his name—he folded and tucked into his pocket, close to his heart.

Words she would never write.

The bag stayed by the stone. The bread was no longer needed. Nothing was needed anymore.

---

The path led into the forest.

He walked until the crunch of branches gave way to the rustle of leaves. Silence followed, but he didn't stop.

Somewhere ahead, beyond the trees, light flickered—or so it seemed.

He stepped toward it, not knowing what awaited.

The empty envelope lay against his heart. Warm from his warmth. The only thing left.

An echo of what never had the chance to begin.
