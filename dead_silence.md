# Dead Silence

He walked along the path where yesterday grass whispered in the wind, touching his boots with soft fingers. Now it lay trampled, black with soot, as if the earth itself had suffocated. The air hung heavy, thick with smoke and an acrid tang, like the echo of a scream that never ended. His steps crunched on charred branches, and each sound tore through the silence, too loud in this dead world. He adjusted the bag strap, where lay a crust of bread and a letter he'd carried three days. A letter for Mara. He imagined her laugh, loud as a bell, and eyes squinting from the sun. But there was no sun. The sky pressed down, leaden and merciless, and in his chest grew something cold, sharp as glass.

The village was ahead. He knew it from childhood: crooked roofs, smoke from chimneys, laughter pouring from behind fences. Summer evenings Mara braided a grass crown for him, laughing that he was now "king of the meadow." Old Yon treated everyone to sour wine, and the freckled boy, always stealing apples, ran between houses until caught by the ear. Now there was no smoke, no laughter. Only the wind drove dust along the empty road, and somewhere in the distance a shutter hammered against a wall like a heart refusing to die.

He stopped at the first house. The door hung on one hinge, as if someone had clung to it until the last. Inside - shadows, pottery shards, an overturned bench. On the table stood a bowl of porridge, covered with an ashen film, as if forgotten forever. On the wall he noticed a burned sign - a circle with three lines, like claws. His heart clenched. He didn't know what it was, but felt: this wasn't just fire. He didn't call out. His voice would drown in this silence like a stone swallowed by black water.

On the square, where people used to sing and dance, now lay cart fragments, fabric scraps, something that could be clothing. Or not clothing. He looked away. His eyes searched for the familiar - a face, a voice, a trace. But they found only hoof prints pressed in the mud, and long furrows, as if someone had dragged something heavy. Or someone. He gripped the bag strap until his fingers went white. "Mara," - he whispered to himself, - "where are you?" A memory surfaced of her reading his last letter, sitting on the porch, her face turned to the sun. "You write like old Yon talks," - she teased, - "all about the road and stars." Now there were no stars. Only dim haze choking the world.

He sat on the square's edge, on a stone still warm, as if keeping someone's warmth. On the fence opposite hung a child's mitten, burned on one edge. It swayed in the wind, as if saying goodbye. The wind brought a sound - either a bird or a tree creak. He closed his eyes. Before him flashed faces: Mara, old Yon, the freckled boy. He wanted to scream, call them, but something inside whispered: they're gone. They're no more. Silence enveloped him like a shroud, and he felt it penetrate him, filling the emptiness where hope and warmth once lived.

He stood. The bag remained lying by the stone. The letter, folded in four, fell to the ground, but he didn't notice. It no longer mattered. The path led to the forest, and he walked until the branch crunch changed to leaf rustle. Silence caught up, but he didn't stop. Somewhere ahead, behind the trees, light flickered - or seemed to. He stepped there, not knowing what awaited. Inside echoed what he had never seen — the end that had happened without him.
