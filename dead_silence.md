# Dead Silence

He walked along path where yesterday grass whispered in wind, touching boots with soft fingers. Now it lay trampled, black with soot, as if earth itself had suffocated. Air hung heavy, thick with smoke and an acrid tang, like the echo of a scream that never ended. His steps crunched on charred branches, and each sound tore silence, too loud in this dead world. He adjusted bag strap, where lay crust of bread and letter he'd carried three days. Letter for Mara. He imagined her laugh, loud as bell, and eyes squinting from sun. But there was no sun. Sky pressed down, leaden and merciless, and in his chest grew something cold, sharp as glass shard.

Village was ahead. He knew it from childhood: crooked roofs, smoke from chimneys, laughter pouring from behind fences. Summer evenings Mara braided grass crown for him, laughing that he was now "king of meadow." Old Yon treated everyone to sour wine, and freckled boy, always stealing apples, ran between houses until caught by ear. Now there was no smoke, no laughter. Only wind drove dust along the empty road, and somewhere in the distance a shutter hammered against a wall like a heart refusing to die.

He stopped at first house. Door hung on one hinge, as if someone clung to it until last. Inside - shadows, pottery shards, overturned bench. On table stood bowl of porridge, covered with ashen film, as if forgotten forever. On wall he noticed burned sign - circle with three lines, like claws. Heart clenched. He didn't know what it was, but felt: this wasn't just fire. He didn't call out. His voice would drown in this silence like a stone swallowed by black water.

On square, where people used to sing and dance, now lay cart fragments, fabric scraps, something that could be clothing. Or not clothing. He looked away. Eyes searched for familiar - face, voice, trace. But found only hoof prints pressed in mud, and long furrows, as if someone dragged something heavy. Or someone. He gripped bag strap until fingers went white. "Mara, - he whispered to himself, - where are you?" Memory surfaced of her reading his last letter, sitting on porch, face turned to sun. "You write like old Yon talks, - she teased, - all about road and stars." Now there were no stars. Only dim haze choking the world.

He sat on square edge, on stone still warm, as if keeping someone's warmth. On fence opposite hung child's mitten, burned on one edge. It swayed in wind, as if saying goodbye. Wind brought sound - either bird or tree creak. He closed eyes. Before him flashed faces: Mara, old Yon, freckled boy. He wanted to scream, call them, but something inside whispered: they're gone. They're no more. Silence enveloped like shroud, and he felt it penetrate him, filling emptiness where hope and warmth once lived.

He stood. Bag remained lying by stone. Letter, folded in four, fell to ground, but he didn't notice. It no longer mattered. Path led to forest, and he walked until branch crunch changed to leaf rustle. Silence caught up, but he didn't stop. Somewhere ahead, behind trees, light flickered - or seemed to. He stepped there, not knowing what awaited. Inside echoed what he had never seen â€” the end, without him.
