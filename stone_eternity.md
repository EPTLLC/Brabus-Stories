# Stone Eternity

The sun burned fiercely on his neck, but he hadn't paid attention to it for a long time. It was like this yesterday, and the day before, it was always like this. Or it seemed to him that it was always like this. The stone, rough, warm, fit in his palm perfectly. He weighed it, tossed it slightly, caught it. Approached the tower. Placed the stone on the edge of masonry, pressed it down, checking if it held. It held. He nodded to himself and went for the next one.

The day was like a pile of other days. Morning - coffee, black, bitter, from a tin mug. Then - to the cart, where stones, piled in a heap, waited for him. Chose without looking, took the first one available. Dragged to the tower. Laid. Again. And so until dark, until his back began to ache and fingers burned from calluses. The tower grew. Not fast, but surely. Already higher than his height, already blocking the horizon. He didn't look up, didn't measure height. Why? Stone after stone - that's all.

Sometimes, accidentally, his gaze caught the upper edge of masonry, and something compressed in his chest. Eyes averted, back to the next stone. Dust crunched on teeth. Wind drove it across the wasteland where the tower stood. Besides it - nothing. No trees, no roads, no people. Only him, stones and cart. And some unimaginable number of passed days. Sometimes coughing, spitting gray slime, wiping mouth with sleeve. Then another stone.

At night, lying on mattress under open sky, watching stars. Distant, indifferent. No thoughts about them. No thoughts at all. Just looking until eyelids grew heavy. Morning - again coffee, cart, stones. Tower. Life came down to this rhythm, simple and merciless, like heartbeat.

Once a stone fell from his hands. Heavy, angular, it crashed on his foot. Pain shot to the back of his head. He hissed, sat on ground, squeezed his foot. The tower stood nearby, silent, gray. He looked at it - for the first time in a long while. It was absurd. Crooked, with uneven seams, as if a child had molded it from sand. He laughed. The laugh came out hoarse, alien. Then fell silent. He stood, limping, and went for a new stone.

Another day it rained. Cold, angry, lashing shoulders, stones, tower. The cart got stuck in mud. Still carrying stones, slipping, falling, cursing into emptiness. Water flowed down face, mixed with sweat. The tower glistened, wet, indifferent. Stone laid, immediately darkened from moisture. Next one. Another.

Sometimes he talked to himself. Not with words - sounds. Grunted, mumbled, muttered something meaningless. Voice drowned in wind, and he didn't hear himself. The tower didn't answer. It just was. He didn't know how much time had passed. Months? Years? Shirt wore out, boots got holes. Face grew a beard, hard as wire. Stones didn't end. Cart was always full. He wasn't surprised. Just took another and carried to tower.

Once he stopped. In the middle of a step, with stone in hands. Looked at the tower. It was enormous, higher than he could imagine. The top was lost in clouds. He stood, held stone and looked. Heart pounded. Throat went dry. He wanted to say something but didn't know what. Stone slipped, hit ground. He didn't bend for it. Just looked at tower. Then turned and went to cart. Took new stone. Returned. Placed it on masonry. Pressed down. Checked. Holds. He nodded to himself and went for the next.

But in that moment when he looked at the tower, something stirred in him. Vague, almost forgotten feeling - like memory of something bigger than stones and dust. He didn't let it form. Didn't allow himself to think. Stone after stone - that's all. The tower grew. He walked. Stone after stone. Nothing else remained.
