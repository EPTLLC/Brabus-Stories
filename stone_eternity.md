# Stone Eternity

The sun burned fiercely on his neck, but he hadn't paid attention to it for a long time. It was like this yesterday, and the day before, it was always like this. Or it seemed to him that it was always like this. The stone, rough and warm, fit in his palm perfectly. He weighed it, tossed it slightly, caught it. He approached the tower. He placed the stone on the edge of the masonry, pressed it down, checking if it held. It held. He nodded to himself and went for the next one.

The day was like a pile of other days. Morning - coffee, black and bitter, from a tin mug. Then - to the cart, where stones, piled in a heap, waited for him. He chose without looking, took the first one available. Dragged it to the tower. Laid it. Again. And so until dark, until his back began to ache and his fingers burned from calluses. The tower grew. Not fast, but surely. Already higher than his height, already blocking the horizon. He didn't look up, didn't measure the height. Why? Stone after stone - that's all.

Sometimes, accidentally, his gaze caught the upper edge of the masonry, and something compressed in his chest. He averted his eyes, back to the next stone. Dust crunched on his teeth. The wind drove it across the wasteland where the tower stood. Besides it - nothing. No trees, no roads, no people. Only him, the stones and the cart. And some unimaginable number of passed days. Sometimes he was coughing, spitting gray slime, wiping his mouth with his sleeve. Then another stone.

At night, lying on his mattress under the open sky, he watched the stars. Distant, indifferent. No thoughts about them. No thoughts at all. Just looking until his eyelids grew heavy. Morning - again coffee, the cart, stones. The tower. Life came down to this rhythm, simple and merciless, like a heartbeat.

Once a stone fell from his hands. Heavy, angular, it crashed on his foot. Pain shot to the back of his head. He hissed, sat on the ground, squeezed his foot. The tower stood nearby, silent, gray. He looked at it - for the first time in a long while. It was absurd. Crooked, with uneven seams, as if a child had molded it from sand. He laughed. The laugh came out hoarse, alien. Then he fell silent. He stood, limping, and went for a new stone.

Another day it rained. Cold, angry, lashing his shoulders, the stones, the tower. The cart got stuck in the mud. He was still carrying stones, slipping, falling, cursing into emptiness. Water flowed down his face, mixed with sweat. The tower glistened, wet, indifferent. He laid a stone, and it immediately darkened from moisture. The next one. Another.

Sometimes he talked to himself. Not with words - sounds. He grunted, mumbled, muttered something meaningless. His voice drowned in the wind, and he didn't hear himself. The tower didn't answer. It just was. He didn't know how much time had passed. Months? Years? His shirt wore out, his boots got holes. His face grew a beard, hard as wire. The stones didn't end. The cart was always full. He wasn't surprised. He just took another and carried it to the tower.

Once he stopped. In the middle of a step, with a stone in his hands. He looked at the tower. It was enormous, higher than he could imagine. The top was lost in the clouds. He stood, held the stone and looked. His heart pounded. His throat went dry. He wanted to say something but didn't know what. The stone slipped, hit the ground. He didn't bend for it. Just looked at the tower. Then he turned and went to the cart. He took a new stone. He returned. He placed it on the masonry. Pressed down. Checked. It holds. He nodded to himself and went for the next.

But in that moment when he looked at the tower, something stirred in him. A vague, almost forgotten feeling - like a memory of something bigger than stones and dust. He didn't let it form. Didn't allow himself to think. Stone after stone - that's all. The tower grew. He walked. Stone after stone. In the emptiness of his endless labor, nothing else remained.
