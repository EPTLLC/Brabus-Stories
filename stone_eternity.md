# Stone Eternity

The sun burned the back of his neck. It was like this yesterday. It was like this the day before. It was like this always—or so it seemed.

A stone settled into his palm, rough, warm. He weighed it, tossed it, caught it. Walked to the tower. Placed it on the edge of the masonry. Pressed down. Holds. Nodded to himself and went for the next one.

---

The day was like all the other days.

Morning—coffee, black, bitter, from a tin mug. Then—to the cart, where stones waited for him. Grabbed the first one he touched. Dragged it to the tower. Laid it down. Again. And so until dark, until his back began to ache and his fingers burned from calluses.

The tower grew. Not fast, but steady. Already taller than him. Already blocking the horizon.

He didn't look up. Didn't measure the height. Why bother? Stone after stone—that's all.

---

Sometimes, by accident, his gaze caught the top edge of the masonry—and something tightened in his chest. He looked away. Went for the next stone.

Dust ground between his teeth. Wind drove it across the wasteland. Besides the tower—nothing. No trees, no roads, no people. Just him, the stones, and the cart.

One day he noticed: the stones never ran out. The cart was always full. He took ten—the same amount remained. Took twenty—same thing. He stood, staring at the pile of stones, and something cold stirred inside.

He decided not to think about it. Picked up a stone and carried it to the tower.

---

At night he lay on a mattress under the open sky and watched the stars. Distant. Indifferent.

Sometimes—rarely, almost never—something flickered at the edge of consciousness. Not a thought. A feeling. Warmth. Laughter. Someone's hands on his shoulders. Light—not sunlight, different. Soft. Alive.

He didn't let it take shape. Closed his eyes. Waited for it to pass.

Morning—coffee, cart, stones. Tower.

---

One day a stone slipped from his hands. Heavy, angular, it crashed onto his foot. Pain shot up to the back of his skull.

He sat on the ground, hissed, clutched his foot. The tower stood nearby—silent, gray, crooked, with uneven joints. As if a child had molded it from sand.

He laughed. The laugh came out hoarse, foreign.

"Why?" he asked aloud.

The voice was unfamiliar. He couldn't remember when he'd last spoken.

The tower didn't answer. The wind didn't answer. No one answered.

He stood up. Limping, went for a new stone.

---

Another day it rained. Cold, angry, it lashed at his shoulders, at the stones, at the tower. The cart sank into the mud.

He kept hauling anyway. Slipped. Fell. Got up. Fell again.

Water ran down his face, mixed with sweat. The tower gleamed, wet, indifferent.

He laid a stone—and it immediately darkened from moisture. The next one. Another. Another.

He didn't stop. To stop meant to think. To think meant to ask. And he didn't want the answer.

---

His shirt wore through. His boots fell apart. His face grew a beard, coarse as wire.

How much time had passed? Months? Years? He didn't know. Didn't want to know.

The stones never ran out. The cart was always full. He stopped looking at it. Just grabbed and carried.

Stone after stone. Step after step. Day after day.

---

One day he stopped.

Mid-step, stone in hand. Just stopped.

Looked at the tower.

It was enormous. Taller than he could have imagined. The top vanished into clouds. A gray mass reaching into the sky—and him, small, stone in hand, at its base.

His heart pounded. His throat went dry.

"For whom?" he whispered.

He didn't know. Didn't remember. Once, maybe, he knew. Once, maybe, it made sense. But now—emptiness. A tower no one would see. Labor no one needed. A life spent on stones.

And then—a flash.

A face. A woman's. A smile. Warm eyes. A voice—"Come here, I've missed you." Children's laughter from somewhere to the side. A smell—bread? flowers?—something homey, forgotten. Light pouring through a window. Happiness. Real, not imagined.

He stood, and tears ran down his cheeks. He couldn't remember when he'd last cried.

The stone slipped from his hands. Hit the ground.

He stood.

Looked at the tower.

Looked at his hands—calloused, cracked, foreign.

The light in his memory faded. The face blurred. The voice grew quiet.

He could go. Somewhere. Away from the tower. Search for what was. Or what remained.

He stood for a long time.

Then bent down. Picked up the stone. Turned to the tower.

Placed it on the masonry. Pressed down. Checked. Holds.

Nodded to himself.

And went for the next one.
