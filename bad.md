# BAD

## 1. RELEASE

The prison creaked and groaned.

Concrete corridors hummed like an overloaded transformer. Three years he'd walked these guts. Now they echoed with every step—as if the prison wanted to remember the sound.

He was walking to freedom.

Freedom—the only thing that's inevitable. They might stop beating you. Or they might not. You don't control that. Only the magic number on paper—inevitable and unshakeable.

"Collect your belongings and proceed to exit."

Hands behind back. Corridor after corridor. Every guard he passed nodded. Everyone knew—today this lunatic walks free.

Words were short. Dry. Unusually alive.

"Hang in there."
"Stop coming back."
"No more solitary for you."
"Give it up."

Not routine phrases. A farewell to someone who'd lived three years in solitary brighter than most live their whole lives on the outside.

When he passed the cells—the prison howled.

Everyone screamed.

"FREEDOM, BROTHER!"
"LIVE!"
"DON'T COME BACK!"
"HOLD ON, PSYCHO!"

Someone beat iron against bars in rhythm. Someone reached hands through the bars. Someone just roared.

This wasn't cons saying goodbye to a con. This was the system seeing off someone who was above it.

At the gates, the guard with the keys said:

"I don't know how you survived this. But don't come back. This isn't your place."

The gates began to slide apart.

Light hit his eyes. Air hit his lungs.

He walked out.

And in that same second—a sound. He would have recognized it among thousands.

Heavy breathing. Paws on asphalt. Broken rhythm. A howl turning into a whimper.

The dog flew at him like a missile.

Knocked him down. Howled. Pressed close. Licked his face—three years of longing in every movement. Trembled all over, as if afraid this was a dream.

He lay on cold concrete.

Bad was crying.

A dog can cry. If it waited for you three years.

Something warm spread across his chest.

Bad had pissed himself from happiness.

## 2. WAR

Grozny. Winter of ninety-five.

The city lay torn open, like a corpse after autopsy. Buildings without walls, walls without buildings. Snow mixed with concrete dust and turned gray still in the air.

He was nineteen.

They dropped them in January—green, stupid, sure that war was like the movies. A week later, eleven remained from the platoon. A month later—he stopped counting.

He learned everything.

Shooting by sound. Sleeping in mud. Not puking from the smell. Dragging the wounded. Finishing off—when needed. Not thinking—always.

One night burned in forever.

Clearing a basement. Dark, flashlight cutting a cone, rifle at shoulder. In the corner—movement. He spun, finger on trigger.

A kid. Maybe twelve. Nothing in his hands. Eyes—huge, white in the darkness.

Behind him—Seryoga, hometown buddy, the only one he still talked to.

"Waste him. Might be rigged."

The kid didn't move. Just looked.

He looked back. One second. Two. Eternity.

Lowered the barrel.

"Go. Fast."

The kid vanished into darkness like he'd never been.

Seryoga spat:

"You're fucking crazy."

Maybe. But he knew: if he'd pulled the trigger—something inside would have broken forever. He'd seen them. Those who crossed the line. They came home, but they didn't come home. Shell—yes. Person—no.

He came back in March.

Mother died while he was there. Father drank before the war, now he just never sobered up. The apartment smelled sour and old. The city lived its life—kiosks, gangsters, cops, old ladies by the entrance.

He stood in the middle of the yard where he grew up.

A stranger.

Empty.

Needed by no one.

---

## 3. THE TEST

Suburban cottage outside Moscow. December ninety-six.

Snow crunched underfoot. The light above the garage flickered. Old German cars pulled up one after another.

Along the fence—eight men.

Kids who'd lived more than they should have. Each stood straight, but eyes gave it away—this night would burn in forever.

He was called through friends of friends. They said: there are people who need people. Serious. Real.

He came.

Two elders brought out a cardboard box. Set it on the snow.

The lid lifted.

Inside—eight puppies. Small, warm, blind, squeaking.

The elder said calmly:

"Those who complete the task—stay. Those who can't—better leave now."

Pistols were handed out. Cold metal settled into palms.

Seven shots.

Seven pops. Seven bodies.

He stood last.

The puppy trembled. Looked up. Blinked. Searched for warmth.

He raised the barrel.

Grozny. Basement. Kid with white eyes.

Lowered it.

Didn't flinch. Everyone knew—he could burn down a block for his own. Wasn't scared—he wasn't scared of anything, and they knew that too. He just didn't cross the line.

Silence.

The elders exchanged glances. Barely noticeable. A conversation without words—one second, and the decision was made.

---

## 4. THE BURIAL

He went out at night. Thought—alone.

Gathered the seven bodies into the box. Carefully. Like his own.

By an old spruce he dug a hole. Ground rang, broke, resisted. Lowered each one gently.

Crouched down. Palms in snow. Breath steaming.

A small snout nudged his fingers.

The last puppy. The one he didn't kill. Nuzzling, whimpering quietly.

And then—clapping.

He dropped to the ground, covering the puppy with his body. Instinct. He'd remember later—in the dim light of solitary.

But it wasn't gunshots.

Applause.

Sparse. Heavy. Rough.

In the shadows stood the elders. Those whose names aren't written in any papers. They'd seen everything.

One said:

"You're with us."

And left.

He understood: the path didn't begin with a shot.

With a refusal.

---

## 5. THE PATH

They didn't make him a killer. Not because he couldn't—because he was needed for something else.

He solved problems. The kind you can't solve with a gun. He was respected. He was heard. He wasn't refused.

War looked out from his eyes. And the basement. And the kid he let go. And the puppy he didn't kill. Too much for anyone to refuse him.

---

## 6. BAD

The puppy grew into a dog.

Staffordshire—thirty kilos of muscle, jaw like a trap, gaze like an x-ray. But to him—just Bad. The one who waits at the door. The one who sleeps at his feet. The only one who would never betray.

Bad went through everything.

Night conversations, when the master sat in the kitchen staring at the wall. Bad would lie beside him, rest his head on his leg. Didn't whine. Just was there.

Women came and went. Bad tolerated them. For the master's sake. They didn't understand the main thing—what it means to lie on the floor when the master comes home at four in the morning, smelling of gunpowder and someone else's blood. What it means not to leave his side when he doesn't get up from the couch for three days, staring at the ceiling.

Once they carried the master in.

Lots of blood. Lots of doctors. Then—six months in a wheelchair. He was a shadow of himself. Not the strong one, but someone quiet, broken.

But every evening—together. Couch, TV, hand on Bad's head.

Bad missed those times.

Because then the master got back on his feet. And it started again—speed, powder, sleepless nights. Bad hated those nights. The master came back a stranger—smelled of chemicals, laughed loud, but his eyes glittered and looked through you.

But Bad waited. Always.

---

## 7. THE FALL

Cocaine ate him slowly.

First—for the rush. Then—to get out of bed. Then—to stop thinking.

He drove his 850 like he didn't care. Three hundred on the speedometer. Bad in the back—the only passenger who never asked to stop.

Mistakes piled up.

Wrong words to wrong people. Wrong decisions at wrong times. He became dangerous—not to others, to his own.

They took him on the highway. Three cars, lights flashing, guns in his face.

Gun in the glove box. Not his, but that didn't matter anymore.

Three years. Could have been less, but he didn't give anyone up, as usual.

Bad stayed with the only person he trusted after the master. Childhood friend. The one who didn't ask questions.

---

## 8. SOLITARY

Prison isn't walls.

Prison is time that chews you like gum. Slowly. Tastelessly. Endlessly.

Solitary is when time chews louder.

Four walls. Bunk. Hole in the corner. Window the size of a book, near the ceiling.

He survived on exercise. Push-ups, abs, squats—to failure, until darkness filled his eyes. Then again. And again. Until the body shut down the head.

He thought.

About Grozny. About the basement. About the kid with white eyes. About puppies in the snow. About Bad.

Bad came to him every night in dreams. Sometimes—as a puppy, nuzzling his palm. Sometimes—grown, lying beside him, warm, heavy.

He'd wake up and for a few seconds not know where he was.

Then he'd know.

And that was the worst part.

---

## 9. SECOND RELEASE

Gates again.

Light again.

Bad no longer flew—ran heavy, lumbering. Gray on his muzzle now. But the eyes—the same. Alive. Loyal to the last cell.

He dropped to his knees. Bad pressed into his chest. Froze.

They stayed like that for a long time.

He whispered something into the gray head. Bad listened. Understood.

Understood everything.

---

## 10. THIRD RELEASE

He came out drained.

Bad—old, heavy, barely walking.

But walking. To the gates. Waiting.

When the gates parted—Bad got up. Slowly. Walked toward him.

Didn't run. Couldn't anymore.

But walked.

They met halfway. He sat on the asphalt. Bad lay beside him. Put his head on his knees.

In the dog's eyes was one thing:

"You did it again. But I still waited."

---

## 11. THE END

Twelve years—the ceiling for a Stafford.

Bad stopped eating. Stopped getting up. Lay in his spot and breathed—heavy, with a rasp.

He drove him to the clinic in the same car they used to race in. Bad lay on the back seat. Looked out the window.

Maybe remembering.

Cold metal table. IV drip. The vet said something—he didn't hear.

He held Bad's paw. Big, heavy, familiar down to the last crack.

Bad looked at him. Straight. Like his whole life.

Didn't complain. Didn't whine. Just looked.

Last breath.

The paw went limp.

He sat there another hour. Holding.

Dogs don't explain. Dogs know.

---

## 12. FINALE

He didn't become what they tried to make him.

He proved it in the basement of Grozny. At the box with puppies—sealed it.

His whole life, beside him was the dog he didn't kill.

Bad.

The dog who held his humanity where others' had rotted long before death.

He stood at the fresh grave in the backyard. A small mound.

Wind drove dry leaves.

He was silent.

Then said—quietly, just with his lips:

"Thanks, brother."

Turned and walked away.

But every evening, coming home, he still heard—for a second, half a second:

Paws on the floor. Heavy breathing. Tail against the wall.

Bad greeting him.

Would greet him always.
