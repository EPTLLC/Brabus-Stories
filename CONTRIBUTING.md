## How to Contribute

### For Small Fixes (Typos, Grammar)
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b fix/typo-in-echo`
3. **Make your changes** with clear, minimal edits
4. **Test** that links and formatting still work
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with descriptive title

### For Larger Changes (Translations, Features)
1. **Open an Issue first** to discuss the proposed changes
2. **Wait for approval** before starting significant work
3. **Follow the same PR process** once approved

## Style Guidelines

### For Text Corrections
- **Preserve the author's voice** and style choices
- **Minimal changes** - fix errors, don't rewrite
- **Maintain consistency** between English and Russian versions
- **Keep the same tone** and mood

### For Technical Contributions
- **Follow existing patterns** in file structure and naming
- **Test thoroughly** before submitting
- **Document changes** clearly in PR description
- **Maintain cross-platform compatibility**

## File Structure Rules

When making changes, maintain:
- **Consistent naming**: `story_name.en.md` and `story_name.ru.md` pattern (if restructuring)
- **Header metadata**: Keep the comment headers in all files
- **Link integrity**: Ensure all README links still work
- **Bilingual parity**: Changes to one language should consider the other

## Review Process

1. **All PRs are reviewed** by the author (Brabus)
2. **Small fixes** are typically merged quickly
3. **Larger changes** may require discussion and iteration
4. **Translation PRs** may need native speaker review

## Recognition

Contributors will be acknowledged in:
- **README contributors section** (for significant contributions)
- **Git commit history** (for all contributions)
- **Release notes** (for version-impacting changes)
