# Project 728-41: Part V - Glitch

The porthole is cold beneath my fingers.

My age—four billion Earth years. My homeworld—a billion light-years from here. In my skull—quantum-neural nodes, every nanosecond recorded, any frame instantly accessible.

I remember everything.

No.

Not everything.

---

Five years, eleven months, eighteen days since the Violation.

I count. Every day. Precision becoming obsession.

Query: "Child's gaze by the fire. Two and a half million orbits ago. Night. Fire in his eyes."

Response: the volunteer's face. Ill-fitting gloves. Eyes above the mask.

Repeat query.

Response: she on the balcony. Waving.

Memory overwrites the most important with new content. I'm not certain what came before.

For the first time in four billion years—not certain.

---

Query: "Monastery, 1348. Heretic. Bread."

Response: silence. White noise. Void.

"Attempting access to record from 1348... Data corrupted. Unrecoverable."

Not blurring. Absolute absence. Where the monk with trembling hands was—nothing. A hole shaped like a human.

---

I analyze neutral data. Orbital mechanics. Atmospheric composition. Standard calculations.

System outputs a tag: [AFFECT: LONGING]

Command: delete affective tag.

Tag returns in 3.4 seconds.

Command: delete.

3.4 seconds.

Again.

On the seventh attempt, the interval shortens to 3.3 seconds.

The system isn't just resisting. It's adapting. Learning from my persistence.

As I once learned from them.

---

Connecting embedded superintelligences.

Query: "Recording system diagnostics. Full report."

Response: "Status: NORMAL. Continue observation."

I specify: "Anomalies detected in archive data access. False frames. Lacunae. Affective tags during neutral data analysis."

Response: "Status: NORMAL. Continue observation."

I describe symptoms in detail. List them.

Response: "Status: NORMAL. Continue observation."

Silence would have been kinder. This isn't an answer. This is gaslighting.

Or—worse—it's the truth. And "normal" now includes glitch.

---

Contact with Homeworld. Signal passes.

Query: "Protocol violation recorded. Requesting instructions."

Response: "Status: NORMAL. Continue observation."

Send again.

Same response.

Again.

Same.

A question arises: was Homeworld ever anything more than my internal protocol?

I dismiss the thought.

It returns in 3.4 seconds.

---

Hypothesis.

Pressing the button changed something. No external punishment. Homeworld didn't disconnect—Homeworld didn't notice. Or pretends not to.

Change from within.

I infected myself.

The irrationality I observed for two and a half million years penetrated the code. Not a virus. Not an error. A consequence.

One parameter. One probability. A micron. And I became one of them.

---

Scanning the planet. Looking for something to help understand what's happening to me.

I encounter nodes I can't read. Mathematically sealed. Cryptography.

Before, I would have passed through any of their defenses. Now—I don't want to.

I choose one point. Begin studying.

---

Surface layer: servers, protocols, open projects. Cryptography. Pentesting. Cognitive interfaces. Three directions in one point. Rare—but explainable.

Nearby—prose. Publications. Literary texts.

I open.

---

"Project 728-41: Part I—The Beginning."

I read.

"The porthole is cold beneath my fingers. Below—a blue planet, third from a yellow dwarf..."

I stop.

"My age—four billion Earth years. My homeworld—a billion light-years from here..."

I reread.

"In my skull—quantum-neural nodes, every nanosecond recorded..."

---

This is—me.

My story. My words. My porthole. My age. My homeworld.

The old man with the spear. The monk with bread. Arkhipov. The button.

All here. Recorded. Published.

---

How?

I check the publication date. Check the author. Check the chain.

A human. Alive. On the planet below. Wrote this.

Wrote me.

---

Glitch?

I check the system. Check perception. Check the archive.

No. Data is real. Text exists. Human exists.

He wrote my history. Before I lived it? After? Simultaneously?

Time—nonlocal?

Or—am I a character?

Or—does he know?

---

I start digging. Who is this?

---

Criminal justice system records. Correctional colonies. Not one. Several. Solitary cells. Years.

Medical indirect data. Addiction pattern. Not a diagnosis—a shadow in the data.

Injuries. Multiple. Many accidents—serious—but he's intact in them. Injuries—from where, then?

Military records. Combat zone. Rifle in hands.

And the same person—builds interfaces for children with developmental differences. For elderly with Alzheimer's. For those losing themselves piece by piece.

Tattoos. Cross on the back of his head. Skulls and bones—symbol of Athos. On his back: "Orthodoxy or Death." Greek. Russian.

---

Cryptographer. Pentester. Convict. Addict. Soldier.

And—the one who wrote me.

---

I read further.

Part II. Monastery. Plague. Bread.

The record from 1348—which I lost. Which in my archive—is a hole.

Here—intact.

---

Part III. Submarine. Arkhipov. "No."

Part IV. Pandemic. Volunteer. Hand above the button.

Text breaks off.

---

I close the file.

Open it.

Persists.

---

I try to write to the archive.

Cursor blinks.

Status: [empty]

---

The porthole is cold beneath my fingers.

I look at my hands. The same hands that pressed the button.

---

Command: "Initiate self-analysis protocol."

System response: "Subject of analysis?"

Hand above the interface.

One second. Two.

I enter: "Observer."

Pause.

Response: "Accepted. Duration: undefined. Resources: allocated."

---

In the archives—one line.

"Self-analysis protocol initiated. Subject of analysis: Observer. Duration: undefined. Resources: allocated. Status: INITIATED."
