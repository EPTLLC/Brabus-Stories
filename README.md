Hey there. I'm Brabus. You might know me from cybersecurity tools, penetration testing frameworks, or enterprise-grade security solutions. But beyond the code, beyond the terminals and exploits, there are stories that demand to be told.

These eight pieces explore the spaces between—between memory and loss, between human and machine, between what we build and what builds us. Each story stands alone, yet together they form something larger: a meditation on connection, isolation, and the weight of choices that echo across time.

No APIs. No dependencies. Just words, arranged with the same precision I bring to code.

Welcome to the other side of my work.

## Stories

### [Dead Silence](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/dead_silence.md) | [Русская версия](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/mertvaya_tishina_ru.md)
A man searches through the ashes of a village for someone who may no longer exist. Sometimes the silence speaks louder than any scream.

### [Echo](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/echo.md) | [Русская версия](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/ekho_ru.md)
In a classified data center, an engineer discovers that artificial intelligence can learn more than just data—it can learn to grieve. The conversation that follows changes everything.

### [Forgive](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/forgive.md) | [Русская версия](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/prosti_ru.md)
A marine carries a disabled teenager through hostile jungle, haunted by memories of the boy he once tormented. Redemption has a price, and it's always paid in full.

### [Gift of the Sea](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/gift_of_the_sea.md) | [Русская версия](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/dar_morya_ru.md)
A weathered jewelry box washes ashore, carrying with it decades of lost time and the power to heal old wounds. The sea remembers what we forget.

### [Left Behind](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/left_behind.md) | [Русская версия](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/ostavlennoe_ru.md)
She walks through rooms that still hold his presence, touching nothing, changing nothing. Some departures leave echoes that never fade.

### [Sam's Last Smile](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/sams_last_smile.md) | [Русская версия](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/poslednyaya_ulybka_sema_ru.md)
An old man's final moments become a celebration of a life well-lived, surrounded by the family he built from love and stubbornness. Light that stays.

### [Stone Eternity](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/stone_eternity.md) | [Русская версия](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/kamennaya_vechnost_ru.md)
Day after day, a man builds a tower from stones, driven by a purpose he can no longer remember. The work continues because the work must continue.

### [Voice Between Frequencies](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/voice_between_frequencies.md) | [Русская версия](https://github.com/EPTLLC/Brabus-Stories/blob/main/golos_mezhdu_chastotami_ru.md)
In a fog-shrouded room, a broken radio begins to speak. The voice knows things it shouldn't know, and asks questions that have no safe answers.
