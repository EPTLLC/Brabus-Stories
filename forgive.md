# Forgive

## Day One

Smoke burned his eyes.

Leon crawled through the mud, dragging the boy with him. Torn uniform clung to his body, knees sinking into black muck. The village behind them was burning—crackling, the stench of charred wood, somewhere in the distance screams. Or so it seemed.

The boy was maybe fourteen. Maybe fifteen. Body twisted, arms unresponsive, legs dragging. Cerebral palsy—Leon had seen cases like this. But this one was alive. Eyes—dark, wet—looked at him, and there was no fear in them. Something else.

The radio crackled.

"Leave him, Leo! Chopper's leaving!"

Leon didn't answer. Clenched his teeth. Kept crawling.

The roar of rotors swelled, then began to fade. Dust kicked up, filled his eyes, his mouth. When Leon raised his head—the helicopter was a dot on the horizon.

He lay in the mud, breathing hard. The boy beside him—the same. Looking at him. Fingers trembling, scratching the ground.

Leon looked at those fingers. At those eyes.

And remembered.

---

*American small town. 1984.*

*Parking lot by an abandoned factory. Leon—seventeen, denim jacket, chain around his neck—rips a sheet of paper from Oscar's hands.*

*Oscar is thin, awkward. Arms move in jerks, head tilted slightly. Cerebral palsy. He was drawing something—pencil on crumpled paper. Now the paper is in Leon's hands.*

*"What's this, freak? Art?"*

*The gang laughs. Danny, Marcus, two others. Leon tears the paper in half. Again. Throws it on the asphalt.*

*Oscar looks at the scraps. Reaches for them—slowly, clumsily. Fingers trembling.*

*Leon kicks the paper. Scraps scatter.*

*"Draw some more, genius!"*

*Laughter. But Oscar doesn't cry. Doesn't scream. Just looks at Leon. Eyes—dark, alive. Unbroken.*

*Something stung in his chest. Leon turned away and left. The gang followed.*

*He didn't look back. But Oscar's gaze stayed—like a splinter.*

---

Leon stood up. The boy looked up at him.

"Come on," Leon said. "We have to move."

He tied straps together, rigged something like a harness. Hoisted the boy onto his back. He was light—too light.

To the extraction point—a week's journey. Through jungle. With a load that couldn't walk on its own.

Leon stepped into the green wall.

---

## Day Two

The jungle suffocated.

Heat pressed down like a wet blanket. Vines caught at his boots, branches lashed his face. Sweat poured into his eyes. Leon hauled the boy, and every step sent pain through his back.

The boy wheezed. Fingers scratched at air, at Leon's shoulder, at anything they could reach.

"Enough," Leon snapped.

The boy froze. Looked at him.

Leon fell silent.

At the rest stop he pulled out the canteen. Water—barely a mouthful left. Handed it to the boy, gestured: a little, small sips.

The boy didn't understand. Or couldn't stop. Drank greedily, gulp after gulp, water running down his chin.

Leon snatched the canteen back. Almost empty.

"Damn..."

He took two small sips. Put the canteen away. Looked at the boy.

The boy was clutching something in his hand. A scrap of paper, dirty, crumpled. Leon looked closer. Lines. Pencil strokes. Something like a face.

He drew. This boy drew.

---

*Schoolyard. 1983.*

*Leon and the gang surround Oscar by the fence. He squats, scratching pencil on paper. Drawing something—a tree? a house?*

*Leon grabs the pencil. Snaps it in half. Drops it on the ground.*

*"Draw, genius!"*

*Shoves Oscar. He falls, arms can't break the fall. Lies there, looking at the broken pencil.*

*The gang howls. But Danny looks away.*

*"Too far, Leo."*

*"Shut up."*

*Oscar crawls to the pieces. Picks them up. Tries to fit them together—useless.*

*Leon watches. Something tightens in his chest. He walks away, suppressing the feeling.*

---

*Evening. Diner on the corner. Neon sign flickers—"OPEN."*

*Leon sits on someone's car hood, smoking. Anna comes out of the diner—dark hair, book under her arm. She's a year older, in college.*

*Leon watches her write something in a notebook.*

*"What are you writing?"*

*She looks up.*

*"A quote. 'Shame is the shadow you cast.'"*

*Leon snorts.*

*"Books are for weaklings."*

*"What makes you strong?"*

*He's silent. Doesn't know what to say. She looks at him—calmly, without judgment. And suddenly he feels warm.*

---

*Childhood. Music school.*

*Leon is eight. He sits at the piano, fingers uncertainly touching keys. His mother is beside him—fragile, fair-haired, with tired eyes and a warm smile.*

*"One more time, Leo. You can do it."*

*He plays. A simple melody—the one she composed for him. Light, like her voice.*

*Mother smiles.*

*"You can be anything, Leo. Anything you want."*

*He nods. Believes her.*

*A year later she was gone. The piano fell silent. Father started drinking.*

---

Dawn.

The boy was still asleep, curled on the ground. Leon got up before light. Tore a piece from his shirt, went to collect dew from broad leaves. Drop by drop. Squeezed into the canteen.

When he returned—the boy was watching him. Silent.

Leon held out the canteen.

"Drink. But slowly."

---

## Day Three

Leon fell.

His legs gave out, and he crashed face-first into the dirt. The boy tumbled off his back, groaned.

Leon lay there, breathing hard. No water. No strength. Nothing.

The boy beside him—fingers drawing in the dust. A circle. Lines. Something like a face.

Leon stared at those lines. Like a ghost. Like Oscar was here, beside him, watching with those living eyes.

He wanted to leave the boy. Stand up and walk away. Leave him here, in this godforsaken jungle.

He couldn't.

---

*1985. Fight with a rival gang.*

*Alley behind the warehouses. Dark, only a streetlight at the end. Leon doesn't see the knife—just feels it go into his side. Hot, then cold.*

*He falls. Asphalt wet, smelling of gasoline and blood. His blood.*

*Shouts. Footsteps. Someone bends over him.*

*Then—sirens. Flashing lights. White ceiling. Surgeon's voice—stern, but warm.*

*He wakes in a hospital room. Anna is beside him, holding his hand.*

*"You almost died, Leo. Why?"*

*He doesn't answer. Doesn't know.*

*Irene, Anna's mother, stands by the window. Adjusts the watch on her wrist—old, with a worn strap.*

*"Life isn't a game," she says quietly.*

*Leon turns to face the wall.*

---

*Hospital lobby. Night.*

*Leon wanders the corridors—can't sleep, the stitches pull. In the corner of the lobby—an old piano, dusty, out of tune.*

*He sits. Touches the keys. His fingers remember on their own.*

*Mother's piece. Simple, alive. He plays—hesitantly at first, then with more confidence. The melody fills the lobby.*

*Nurses freeze. Someone peers out of a room.*

*Anna stands in the doorway. Irene beside her. Both watching.*

*"I didn't know you could play," Anna whispers.*

*Leon stands. Leaves without looking at them.*

---

*Empty lot behind the school. 1984.*

*Oscar squats, drawing with chalk on the asphalt. A house. A tree. A sun.*

*Leon walks up. Kicks the chalk—white dust scatters, the drawing smears.*

*"You're not normal. Why bother?"*

*Oscar looks at him. Silent. Then picks up another chalk. Starts drawing again.*

*The gang laughs. But Leon doesn't. Watches Oscar draw—stubborn, silent, not giving up.*

*Walks away. Something aches in his chest.*

---

Dawn.

Leon collected water. Same ritual—dew from leaves, drop by drop.

Returned to camp. The boy was awake—watching him.

Leon sat beside him.

"Just a little more, kid. You can do it. I know you can."

---

## Day Four

Night. The fire was dying, embers glowing red.

Leon sat propped against a rock. The boy beside him, wrapped in his jacket. Breathing weak, uneven. Fingers still scratching the ground—even in sleep.

Leon looked at the drawing the boy had scratched that day. Lines, a circle, something like a face. Just like Oscar's. Exactly the same.

He pulled an envelope from his pocket. Crumpled, dirty. Inside—a letter he'd written many years ago. And a photograph.

The scar on his side ached—old wound, reminder.

Images washed over him. Torn drawing on asphalt. Broken pencil. Smeared chalk. Oscar's eyes—alive, unbroken.

Leon clenched his fist. Nails dug into palm.

"Forgive me," he whispered. "Forgive me."

The boy flinched in his sleep. Fingers drew a circle in the dust. A face.

Somewhere in his head, his mother's melody flared—and faded.

---

*1985. Anna's house.*

*Leon stands at the door, holding a bouquet and a box of chocolates. Stupid, he doesn't even know why he bought them. Anna invited him: "Mom wants to meet you."*

*From the open car window on the street, the radio crackles—The Smiths, "How Soon Is Now?" Guitars trembling like his nerves.*

*He rings the bell.*

*Footsteps behind the door. Uneven, shuffling.*

*The door opens.*

*Oscar.*

*He stands in the doorway—pencil in hand, chalk on his shirt. Looks at Leon. Eyes—the same. Alive. No judgment.*

*Leon freezes. In his head a flash: asphalt, torn paper, the gang's laughter.*

*He lives here. He's Anna's brother? Relative?*

*"He told them," Leon thinks. "They know. Everyone knows."*

*His throat tightens. He sets the bouquet on the floor. Chocolates on top. Turns. Walks away—almost running.*

*Oscar watches him go. Then—at the flowers. His fingers hover over them, like back then, over the scraps of drawing.*

*He doesn't smile. But he doesn't close the door either.*

---

*Diner. Evening.*

*Anna catches Leon on his way out.*

*"You left. Why?"*

*He doesn't look at her.*

*"I didn't know he... that you..."*

*"Oscar is my cousin. He lives with us." She looks at him. "He told me, Leo."*

*Leon is silent. Waits for the blow.*

*"You can be better," she says.*

*He shakes his head.*

*"I love you, Anna. But I'm garbage. Everything I do is wrong. Maybe the army? Start over?"*

*"You don't have to run."*

*She pulls a photograph from her bag. A photo booth shot—she's smiling, eyes shining.*

*"Don't forget."*

*Leon takes it. Puts it in his pocket. Looks at her—long, silent.*

*Then walks away.*

---

*Father's apartment. Empty, dusty.*

*Leon stands in the middle of the room. Bottles on the floor. In the corner—a piano, closed, covered in dust. Father died a week ago. Heart. Or alcohol. What difference does it make.*

*Leon pulls out Anna's photograph. Looks at her smile.*

*Takes a scrap of paper. Writes one word: "Forgive."*

*Puts it in the envelope. The photo too.*

*Tucks it in his pocket.*

*Walks out. Closes the door.*

*The next day he joins the army.*

---

Dawn.

Leon collected water. Returned.

The boy was awake, watching him. Leon handed him the canteen.

For the first time in days he smiled—really smiled, watching the boy drink eagerly.

"That's it. Good job."

---

## Day Five

Dusty plain. Sun in his eyes.

Leon heard the helicopter before he saw it. Roar of rotors, familiar, welcome. He dropped to his knees, raised his hand.

The helicopter descended. Dust kicked up in a wall.

Marines jumped out, ran toward him.

"Load up! Move!"

Medics grabbed the boy. Leon let go—and their eyes met. The boy looked at him. Fingers clutching the scrap of paper with the drawing.

Leon squeezed his hand. A second. Two.

"You made it, kid."

Let go. Stepped back.

Ryan, the senior marine, clapped him on the shoulder.

"You did it, Leo. Damn hero."

Leon didn't answer. Turned—something glinted on the hill, in the distance.

Gunshot.

He didn't hear it. Just—impact in his back, and the ground fell away.

He was falling, and images flashed: Oscar looking at the flowers by the door. Anna saying: "You don't have to run." Mother stroking his head, the piano playing—her piece, light as her voice.

Then—darkness.

---

## Hospital

Night. Chaos.

Stretchers, shouts, footsteps. Anna—in medical scrubs, hair loosely tied back, face tired—bent over a teenager. He was conscious, looking at her. In his hand—a scrap of paper.

She took the drawing. Lines, a circle, a face. Something familiar.

"He'll live," the nurse said. "Stable."

Anna nodded. Turned to the next stretcher. Pulled back the sheet.

Leon.

Eyes closed. Face calm. On his lips—the shadow of a smile.

She froze.

Ryan approached. Eyes red, tired.

"You're Anna?" he asked quietly. "He talked about you. All the time. About his mother who died. About a kid with cerebral palsy he bullied as a child. Couldn't forget." He handed her a crumpled envelope. "This was on him."

Anna took the envelope. Opened it.

A piece of paper. One word: "Forgive."

And a photograph. Her—smiling, eyes shining. Photo booth. Edges bent, paper worn.

He had kept it all these years.

Anna stood holding the envelope. The watch on her wrist ticked—the same one, her mother's.

Inside, everything went quiet.

---

## Epilogue

The drawing hangs in the hospital corridor. Lines, a circle, a face. Beside it—a photograph of Leon. He's smiling—easily, almost shyly.

Below the photograph—a plaque. Name. Dates. And one word:

"Forgive."

Anna walks past every day. Sometimes she stops. Looks.

The clock ticks.

Inside—silence. But not empty. Warm.

Like his mother's piece, the one he played that night in the hospital lobby.

---

*American small town. One year later.*

*Sun through the window. Living room. An old piano by the wall—the same one, from his father's apartment.*

*Anna plays. Fingers touch the keys—uncertain, but right. Mother's piece. The one Leon played in the hospital lobby. She learned it. For him. After him.*

*At the table by the window—two of them. Shoulder to shoulder.*

*Oscar. The boy from the jungle.*

*Hands move alike. Uncertain. Stubborn. Pencil on paper.*

*Oscar doesn't look at his drawing. Just draws beside him. Like he once drew alone.*

*On the wall—framed—that same scrap. Lines, a circle, a face. Next to it—Leon's photograph.*

*The melody flows—simple, light, alive.*

*The boy raises his head. Listens. Then bends over the paper again.*

*Pencils rustle.*

*The piano sounds.*

*Light falls on the drawings—new ones, not yet finished.*

*The circle is complete.*
