# Forgive

## Prologue: Day 1

South America. Smoke over a burnt village cuts the eyes. Leon, a marine in torn uniform, crawls through mud, dragging a teenager with cerebral palsy. His hands tremble, clutching a crumpled piece of paper. The radio crackles: Drop him, Leo! The helicopter's leaving! Leon remains silent, teeth clenched. The helicopter takes off - dust swirls, leaving them alone.

Leon looks at the teenager, those familiar eyes, like someone from the past. With an effort of will, he makes one last dash and disappears into the jungle. To reach the evacuation point with such cargo would take at least a week.

Flashback: American town, 80s. Parking lot by an abandoned factory. Leon in a worn denim jacket tears a drawing from Oscar's hands, a thin guy with cerebral palsy. The paper tears, falls on asphalt. The gang laughs. Oscar reaches for the scraps, hands trembling. Leon kicks the drawing, smirking, but Oscar's gaze, alive, unbroken, stings. He leaves, heart clenching.

## Day 2

The jungle suffocates with heat, vines catch boots. Leon drags the teenager, tied with straps. The boy wheezes, fingers scratch dust. Leon barks: Enough! But the teenager's gaze makes him fall silent.

At rest, giving the flask to the teenager, Leo tries to explain with signs that he shouldn't drink it all. But he drinks gulp after gulp so greedily that Leo has to tear the flask from him. There's almost no water left in it. Taking two small sips, Leon puts away the flask and looks at a scrap of paper in the teenager's hand, lines like a face.

Flashback: School yard. Leon and the gang surround Oscar by the fence. Oscar grips a pencil, scratches paper. Leon snatches the pencil, breaks it, throws it on the ground. Draw, genius! - he laughs, pushing Oscar. He falls, stays silent. The gang laughs, but Danny looks away: Too much, Leo. Leon snaps back, but sees Oscar crawling for the fragments. Leaves, suppressing shame.

At the diner, where a neon sign flickers, he meets Anna. She writes a quote: Shame is the shadow you cast. Leon smirks: Books are for weaklings. She looks: What makes you strong then? He stays silent, feeling warmth.

Flashback: Childhood. Music school. Leon's mother, fragile, smiles while he plays a simple piece on piano, a melody she composed. You can be anyone, Leo, - she says. He nods, fingers catching the familiar melody, light as her voice. Mother died a year later. The piano fell silent, father started drinking.

Dawn, while the teenager still sleeps, Leon goes searching and collecting water. With a torn piece of his shirt, he collects dew from large leaves and strains it into flasks.

## Day 3

Leon falls, the teenager beside him. No water. The teenager moans, fingers draw in dust, circle, lines. Leon watches as if seeing a ghost. Wants to abandon him, but can't.

Flashback: Fight with a rival gang. Leon falls - knife in his side, blood on asphalt. Ambulance, intensive care. Flashes: surgeon in white, voice stern, warm. He comes to. Anna nearby: You almost died, Leo. Why?

Irena, her mother, adjusts the clock. Life isn't a game, - she says quietly. Leon turns away.

In the hospital lobby, an old piano. Leon sits, touches the keys. Plays mother's piece, simple, alive. Nurses freeze. Anna and Irena watch, surprised. Anna whispers: I didn't know... Leon leaves without looking.

Flashback: Wasteland. Oscar draws with chalk on asphalt, house, tree. Leon kicks the chalk, smearing the drawing. You're not normal, why try? - he hisses. Oscar looks, takes new chalk, continues drawing. The gang laughs. Leon stops, watching his stubborn resolve. Leaves.

Dawn: the teenager sleeps, Leon collects water. The ritual unchanged. Returning to camp, Leon looks at the teenager. "Just a little more, kid, I'm sure you can make it."

## Day 4

Night. Fire smolders. Leon by a stone, teenager nearby, wrapped in a jacket. Breathing weak, fingers scratch the ground. Leon looks at the drawing, lines, face. Touches his pocket where the envelope is. The scar reminds of itself with itching.

The image of Oscar - torn drawing, broken pencil, smeared chalk - suffocates. Leon clenches his fist, nails dig into palm. Whispers, almost non-words: Forgive. The teenager breathes, fingers draw circle, face, exactly like Oscar... A fragment of mother's piece flashes, fades.

Flashback: American town, 80s. Leon, recovered, with flowers and candy, at Anna's house. She invited: Mom wants to see. Smell of gasoline, radio plays The Smiths, How Soon Is Now? - guitars tremble like Leon's nerves. He rings. Steps, uneven, shuffling. Oscar opens the door, pencil in hands, chalk on shirt. Those same eyes, without judgment.

Leon freezes, flash: asphalt, torn paper, gang's laughter. He thinks: He told. They know. Throat tightens. Puts flowers on floor, candy on top. Leaves, almost running. Oscar looks at flowers, hands still like that day. He doesn't smile. But doesn't close the door.

Flashback: At the diner. Anna catches Leon: You can be better. He looks: I love you, Anna. But I'm shit. Everything I do is wrong. Maybe the army? Start over? She shakes her head: You don't have to run. Takes out a photo booth picture, she's smiling, eyes shining. Don't forget. Leon takes it, puts it in pocket. Leaves, Oscar's image, drawing on asphalt, pressing.

Flashback: Father's empty apartment. Leon looks at Anna's photo. Dusty piano, bottles on floor. Father dead. He writes on a scrap of paper: Forgive. Puts it in envelope with photo, goes to army.

Dawn water collection time. Leon quenched his thirst and handed the flask to the awakened teenager, smiled sincerely for the first time in days, seeing how joyfully he pounced on the water.

## Day 5

Dusty plain. Helicopter lands, raising sand. Leon, bloodied, drags the teenager. Marines shout: Load up! Medics pull the teenager. Ryan, senior marine, nods: You did it, Leo.

Leon hands over the teenager, their eyes meet. He squeezes his hand. Steps back. Leon turns, catching a glint somewhere in the distance. Gunshot. Leon falls, marines drag his body into the helicopter...

Flashback: Oscar looks at flowers, ribbon with Thank You. Anna touches Leon's hand: You don't have to run. Mother strokes his head, piano sounds, mother's piece. Images merge, picture and sound disappear and turn off.

## Finale: Hospital

Night. Chaos, stretchers. Anna in medical uniform saves the teenager. Face tired, hair carelessly gathered. Clock ticks like Irena's. She sees the drawing in his hand, lines, face. Pulls back the sheet, sees Leon.

Ryan, eyes tired, approaches. Are you Anna? Leo talked about you. About his mother who died. About the kid with cerebral palsy he bullied. He remembered them all the time. Hands over a crumpled envelope: This was with him. Anna opens: letter, Forgive, photo, she's smiling, photo booth, edges bent. Anna nods, clutching the envelope. Clock ticks. Inside, silence remained. And with it—peace.

## Epilogue

The teenager's drawing hangs in the hospital. Lines, face. Nearby, Leon's photo, slight smile. Anna's clock ticks. Inside, silence remained. And with it—peace.
