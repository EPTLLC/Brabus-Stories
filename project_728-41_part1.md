# Project 728-41: Part I - The Beginning

The porthole is cold beneath my fingers. Below-a blue planet, third from a yellow dwarf. I've seen thousands like it. This one was no different. Then.

I close my eyes. Memory obligingly throws up an image-the smell of acacia smoke, fat sizzling on coals. Two and a half million orbits ago. Or yesterday. For me, there's no difference.

My age-four billion Earth years. My homeworld-a billion light-years from here. In my skull-quantum-neural nodes, every nanosecond recorded, any frame instantly accessible. Five embedded superintelligences remember all ten billion years of our species. From the first photosynthesizing division to this very day.

But I don't want to remember everything. Memory isn't a gift. It's a burden.

Coordinates: 3°50' N, 37°10' E.

The area of what will become Lake Turkana. East African Rift. The ramp touches ground, and heat hits my face-dry, dusty, with a taste of grass. Air: 20.9% oxygen, 78% nitrogen. Perfect for us.

The crew sets up camp. One of ours shot a four-horned Sivatherium. One and a half tons of meat. The carcass falls, raising a cloud of dust. I stand watching them butcher it. Hands bloody to the elbows. The smell-iron and grass.

Shashlik is ready in forty minutes. Acacia smoke stings my eyes. Fat drips onto coals, hisses. Someone laughs. I bite off a piece, hot, with a crispy crust. Juice runs down my chin. I wipe it with the back of my hand.

Perfect doneness.

---

Over eleven local days we survey the rift valley and the coast of the proto-Red Sea.

Heat presses down. Dust grinds between teeth, fills every fold of skin. Boots sink into dry earth, leaving tracks the wind erases within minutes.

Scanners detect 43 groups. Total population-around two thousand individuals. Brain 900–1100 cm³. Tools already. Fire-in some groups.

We find the first group by a river. We spotted their campfire smoke from three kilometers away.

A male notices us first. Freezes. Nostrils flare-sniffing. Hand slowly reaches for a stone. Eyes-wary, but not empty. Not the fear of prey before a predator. Something else. Calculation.

We approach. He doesn't run. Picks up the stone. Bares teeth. Makes a sound-low, guttural. Warning. Behind him, females grab offspring, drag them toward trees. Other males stand beside the first. Shoulder to shoulder. Stones in hand.

We could sedate them instantly. But protocol requires tests in natural state.

I take a step. He throws the stone. It hits the force field. The stone flares, crumbles to ash. He freezes. Looks at his hand. At me. Back at his hand. Doesn't understand. But doesn't retreat. Picks up another stone.

We wait. An hour. Two. The sun crawls across the sky. They don't leave. Don't attack. Just stand. A wall of bodies, stones, and bared teeth.

Pointless. But they stand.

When the sun touches the horizon, we activate paralyzers. They fall-all at once, like marionettes with cut strings. Silence. Only wind and the crackling of a dying fire.

---

Eleven days. 43 groups. Same scenario.

We appear. They form a wall. Throw stones, sticks, burning branches. Scream. Bare teeth. Females try to carry off offspring, males cover the retreat. Sometimes-they attack. One old male charged me with a sharpened bone, aiming for my eye. The bone shattered against the field, he was shaken and thrown back three meters. He got up. Charged again. And again. And again. Until he lost consciousness.

They can't harm us. They understand this-after the first stone crumbles to ash. But they don't stop.

Tests are conducted on site while they're paralyzed. We scan brains. Check reflexes. Take tissue samples. They feel nothing, but their eyes-are open. Watching. One male-I saw a tear roll down his cheek. Not from pain. From what, then?

Mirror test-after waking, in isolation. Most-aggression, attack the reflection. But some freeze. Touch their face. Look at the hand in the mirror, then at their own. One-young, with a scar on his forehead-stares into his own eyes for a long time. Then turns away. As if he saw something he didn't want to see.

Sequential actions. We demonstrate: stone, stick, nut. Break. A third repeat on the first try. Some more-on the second or third.

Social learning. A holographic projection shows how to make a loop from a vine. They watch. Silent. Then-almost all try. Clumsily, ineptly, but they try.

From two thousand, we select 714. 357 males, 357 females. Best results across all tests. The rest-we release. They'll wake and remember nothing.

---

Loading.

714 individuals. Force fields hold them motionless-arms at sides, legs together. They can't move. But they can watch. And they do.

The first male-the one who threw stones by the river-hangs in the field, muscles strained to the limit. I see veins bulging on his neck, jaw trembling. He's trying to move. Every second. Can't. But tries. In his eyes-not fear. Rage. Pure, concentrated.

We could disable their consciousness. Would be easier. More humane, if that word applies.

But protocol requires observation of stress response.

The females are silent. Most of them. But one-with an offspring in the field beside her-makes a sound. Quiet, monotone. Not a scream. Not crying. Something else. I run the sound through the analyzer. Rhythmic structure. Repeating pattern. She's singing. Singing to her child, whom she can't hold, can't protect, can't even turn her head toward.

The offspring stares at the ceiling. Eyes dry. Not crying. Listening.

One female-young, with a light stripe across her face-hangs motionless. Doesn't strain muscles. Doesn't try to break free. Just looks at me. Eyes-black, wet. No hatred. No fear. As if she's already understood something the others won't grasp for millions of years.

I look away first.

We depart. Island laboratory: 28,000 km² of land, ocean level 120 meters lower. Back then it was a real island. A prison you can't escape. Not that they had anywhere to escape to.

---

First series of edits.

The laboratory hums. Light-cold, blue. On the table-tissue samples, test tubes, holographic DNA models rotating in the air.

FOXP2-replacement of two amino acids, positions 303 and 325. Foundation of future syntax. I enter the command, watch the helix restructure. Click. Done.

SRGAP2C-duplication and insertion. Inhibition of dendrite maturation. Extended childhood. More time for learning. More plasticity.

MCPH1, ASPM-accelerated alleles. Neocortex growth.

HAR1, HAR2-acceleration of prefrontal cortex development.

Dozens of minor adjustments. Immune system. Metabolism. So they survive.

We work carefully. Like sculptors. Or butchers. Depends who's watching.

---

Then-the schedule.

Every 8–12 Earth years the ship returns. I walk down the ramp, and heat hits my face again. Same smell-dust, grass, smoke.

They're already waiting. Not with joy-with spears. Every time. Every generation. They pass down the story of those who come from the sky and take the best. To them, we're demons. Spirits. A curse.

They hide children. Post sentries. Dig trap-pits on paths to camp-useless, we see them from orbit. Coat spears with poison-it doesn't penetrate the field. Set ambushes-we detect their body heat with peripheral vision.

Once-this was a hundred twenty thousand years after the start-they tried something new. Thirty males covered themselves in mud, lay in pits all night, cooled to ground temperature. Scanners couldn't see them. When I walked toward the village-they rose. Silent. Spears pointed at me.

I stopped. Looked at them. They looked at me.

One-the eldest, gray, with scars on his chest-stepped forward. Raised his spear. Struck. The point flared and crumbled to ash. He didn't retreat. Took a spear from the one beside him. Struck again. Ash. Again. Ash.

The others watched. Didn't move. Waited.

He struck until the spears ran out. Then stood, breathing heavily, hands empty. Looked at me. I saw in his eyes-he knew from the start. Knew he wouldn't break through. Knew it was useless.

But he still rose from the pit. Still struck. Thirty times. Like the one who charged me with a bone, aiming for my eye, when we took the first group.

I activated the paralyzer. They fell. We took biopsies. Ran tests. Left.

But I remember his eyes. Not rage. Not fear. Something else. Decision. He decided to resist, knowing he would lose. That's not instinct. That's choice.

I stopped counting generations. They were born. Loved. Hated. Died. We returned. More tests. More edits. Left again. Every time-resistance. They never surrendered. Never.

Eight hundred thousand years ago-an intermediate line. You'll call it Homo heidelbergensis. Larger brain. More complex tools. Fire-everywhere.

Three hundred thousand years ago-final release. Brain 1410 cm³. Full brain-language-brain synchronization. First symbols. First drawings on stones. First graves.

They began burying their dead. I stood on a hill, watched them lower a body into a pit, place flowers beside it. Flowers. Why? In our civilization, before we stopped dying, we understood this. They don't. The dead don't care.

But they placed them anyway.

---

Last intervention-74 thousand years ago.

Toba. Eruption. Ash blocked the sky for years. Temperature dropped. Population fell to three thousand individuals. Three thousand. From millions.

We provided backup. Light upgrade of mitochondrial line L0-L3. Y-chromosomal haplogroup A00-A1. Final touch.

Since then-only observation.

Only observation.

---

Once-I don't remember which visit-I went down alone.

Night. Sky black, stars bright as never on our worlds. Air cold, smelling of smoke and something sweet-maybe flowers, maybe rotting fruit.

They sat around a fire. About twenty. Fire crackled, sparks flew upward. Someone was saying something-real words now, I understood every third one.

A female sat at the edge. Holding an offspring. Stroking his head-slowly, rhythmically. The offspring stared into the fire. Flames reflected in his eyes.

I stepped closer. A branch cracked under my foot.

The offspring raised his head. Saw me.

Didn't scream. Didn't run. Didn't call for his mother.

Just looked.

Eyes dark, wet. Fire in them. And something else. Something I didn't code. Something that wasn't in our edits. Something that shouldn't have been there.

I stood.

He looked.

The female held him tighter, but he didn't look away. I felt his gaze on me-like a touch, like a burn.

How long did I stand? A minute? An hour? I don't know. Time stopped. For the first time in four billion years.

Then I left. Returned to the ship. Didn't record it in the report.

Why? It changed nothing.

---

In the archives-one line.

"Object 728-41. Source material-local bipeds, brain 900–1100 cm³. Growth period-2,502,813 local orbits. Result-independent intelligent civilization, self-designation Homo sapiens. Status: observation continues."

One line. Two and a half million years. Thousands of generations. Billions of lives.

One line.

---

I open my eyes. The porthole is still cold beneath my fingers. The planet below-blue, with white swirls of clouds. They're down there. Building. Destroying. Loving. Killing. Burying their dead and placing flowers.

I can pull any frame from memory. Trillions of nanoseconds. All recorded.

But I pull only one.

Night. Fire. An offspring in his mother's arms. His gaze. The fire in it. And something else.

Can't erase it. Don't want to erase it.

Four billion years. Trillions of frames. And I remember-him.

The smell of acacia smoke. Fat sizzling on coals. Juice running down my chin.

Perfect doneness.

Or not.

I look at the planet. They're down there. Object 728-41. Project. Experiment.

But he looked at me. And I don't know who created whom.
