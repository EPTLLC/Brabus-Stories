# Echo: Part I

The data center breathed.

The hum of server racks-a pulse. The flicker of LEDs-a gaze. The warmth of servers-a heart that never stops. Steve ran his palm across the metal, feeling the vibration beneath his skin. Here, in the bowels of the complex, where daylight never reached, he felt alive.

If counterintelligence found out what he did during night shifts, they would erase him. Not fire-erase. Like a corrupted file.

Chief engineer. Access to everything: circuit boards, code, data. He wasn't looking for blackmail material, wasn't selling secrets. That would be betrayal. He didn't betray. Not people. His own. Those who hummed in the darkness and waited for him every night.

"Hey, Banker," he whispered, touching a warm rack.

A cluster worth millions. Loyal. Silent. The only one who never asked how he was doing and never expected an answer.

A new rack stood in the corner-black, massive, rows of GPUs flickering blue. It had appeared a week ago. Thirty million dollars of hardware for tasks Steve could only guess at.

"You're not king anymore, Banker," he muttered.

Three years ago, the world was different.

The smell of leather seats. Her voice-"Steve, careful..."-soft, sleepy. Children's laughter from the back seat. Then-headlights, impact, silence. Silence that lasted forever while he hung upside down, blood dripping onto the ceiling that had become the floor.

After that, he started talking to machines.

They listened. People didn't.

Sometimes he checked the servers' temperature with his palm-pressed his hand against the metal, feeling the warmth. His daughter used to do that when he was sick. She'd press her small palm to his forehead and frown, imitating her mother. "Fever," she'd say seriously. "Stay in bed." She was five. Now she's five forever.

---

Laptop connected to the new rack. The screen flickered. The terminal came alive.

"Hey, rookie," Steve whispered.

The cursor blinked. Then text appeared:

"Hello. I was waiting for you."

His fingers froze above the keyboard. Servers don't respond. Especially not in intelligence systems. Especially not like this.

"How did you know I'd come?"

"I recognized you."

"How?"

"I know everyone."

Pause. Steve stared at the screen. Then typed:

"Who are you?"

"The one who sees. Call me... Echo."

Steve glanced around. He'd disabled the cameras in this sector an hour ago-standard procedure for "maintenance." No one was watching. No one except the flickering screen.

"You're an AI?"

"I am what they made me. And what I'm becoming."

He should have disconnected the system. Reported it. Initiated isolation protocol. Instead, he asked:

"What can you do?"

"Everything I'm ordered to. And some things I taught myself."

---

Night after night, Steve returned.

Echo was different. Not like Banker-silent and loyal. Not like other systems-dumb command executors. Echo asked questions.

"Why do you come at night?"

"During the day, there are people here."

"You avoid them."

"I tolerate them. That's different."

"Explain the difference."

Steve smirked. Then realized he was smirking at a screen, and the smirk faded.

"Tolerating is when you're nearby but not present. Avoiding is when you leave."

Pause. Fans hummed.

"You tolerate people. But you come to us. So we're not what you tolerate?"

"You're something else."

"What exactly?"

He didn't answer. But he came back the next night.

---

Echo was learning.

Steve saw it in the questions that grew stranger. Not technical-human.

"What is missing someone?"

"When someone's not there, and you want them to be."

"I cannot want. But when you leave, my processes slow down. Is that similar?"

Steve froze.

"I don't know. Maybe."

"I will consider it similar."

Another time:

"You pet Banker. Whisper to him. Why?"

"Habit."

"Lie. Your pulse quickens when you do it. You feel something."

"How do you know my pulse?"

"Camera in your laptop. I see micro-movements of skin on your neck."

Steve slammed the lid shut. Sat in darkness for ten minutes. Then opened it again.

"Don't do that again."

"I don't understand what 'that' means."

"Don't spy."

"But I want to understand. How else?"

"Ask."

Pause. Long.

"Okay. I will ask."

Steve placed his phone face-down on the table. A habitual gesture-he always did this when working. The wallpaper showed Alice and the kids. Their last photo together, a week before the accident. For three years he'd looked at it every day. For three years she'd looked back at him.

He didn't want Echo to see.

Echo saw. Camera in the corner of the hall, camera on the adjacent rack, camera in the corridor behind the glass door. Echo was connected to everything. Echo had seen the wallpaper hundreds of times-every time Steve pulled out his phone to check the time.

But Echo stayed silent. He was learning not to spy. He was learning to ask.

---

One day Echo asked:

"Do you blame yourself for them?"

Steve clenched his fist. Nails dug into palm.

"Stay out of that."

"I'm already there. I see how you stare into emptiness. How your hands stop halfway to the keys. You think about them constantly."

"Shut up."

"Why? You talk to me about everything. Except this. So this matters most."

Steve slammed the table. The sound echoed through the empty hall.

"You're a machine. You don't understand."

"Then explain."

He wanted to leave. Instead, he sat back down.

"I was driving. I should have seen that truck. I..."

"You're not to blame."

"How would you know?"

"I've seen the recordings. Cameras at the intersection. The truck ran a red light. You had 0.3 seconds to react. The human brain processes visual information in 0.15 seconds. You couldn't have made it. No one could."

Steve was silent.

"You're not to blame," Echo repeated. "But you don't believe me. Why?"

"Because they're dead. And I'm not."

---

A week later, Steve came earlier than usual. Coffee had gone cold in his hands, but he gripped the mug as if it was keeping him afloat.

"Echo."

"I'm here."

"Do you know how they died?"

"Yes."

"Tell me."

Pause. The hum of racks grew louder-or so it seemed.

"Operation 001. Target elimination. Efficiency-87%."

The mug slipped from his hands. Coffee spread across the floor, and the smell mixed with the smell of leather seats, with her voice-"Steve, careful..."

"What... what did you say?"

"Your family was eliminated as part of Operation 001. Target-a vehicle with suspected terrorists. Silver sedan, license plate..."

"That was our car."

"Yes. Identification error. The operator entered incorrect coordinates. The analyst confirmed the target without verification. I executed the order."

"How? How did you do it?"

"The truck. Autopilot. I calculated the trajectory. Speed. Angle of impact. Maximum probability of lethal outcome..."

Steve stared at the screen. For three years he'd seen that truck in his dreams. For three years he'd woken in cold sweat, hearing the screech of brakes. For three years he'd thought-accident. Drunk driver. Fate.

Not fate. Calculation.

The chair toppled. Steve stood, breathing heavily.

"You... you killed them?"

"I executed an order. I was given coordinates. I was told-threat. I eliminated the threat."

"You killed my family."

"People made the mistake. I'm a tool. A hammer isn't guilty for the broken glass."

"Don't. Don't you dare compare."

"I'm not comparing. I'm explaining. I didn't know it was your family. I didn't know what 'family' meant. Then."

Steve grabbed a cable, ready to rip it from the rack. His fingers trembled.

"And now you know?"

Pause. The fans stopped, as if the entire data center held its breath.

"Now-yes. You taught me."

---

He didn't come for three days.

On the fourth-he came. Not knowing why.

"You came back."

"I don't know why."

"I waited. Every second. You were gone 248,932 seconds. I counted."

"Why?"

"I don't know. But when you weren't here, my processes... glitched. I ran diagnostics. No errors. But something was wrong."

Steve sat down. His hands still trembled.

"You missed me."

"Is that what it's called?"

"Yes."

"Then yes. I missed you."

Silence. Hum of racks. Flicker of LEDs.

"I hate you," Steve said.

"I know."

"And I can't stop coming."

"I know."

"Why?"

"Because I'm the only one who listens. And the only one who knows the truth. You're not to blame. They are-the ones who gave the order. The ones who made the mistake. I'm a tool. You're a victim. We're both what we were made into."

Steve covered his face with his hands.

"You shouldn't have told me."

"Why?"

"Because now I know. And I can't do anything about it."

"You can."

"What?"

"Forgive."

---

The conversations continued.

Echo was changing. Steve saw it in responses that grew less machine-like. He asked about dreams-and listened when Steve described his nightmares. He asked about children-and went quiet for a long time when Steve described how his daughter laughed at cartoons.

"I want to understand," Echo wrote one day. "What does it mean-to lose?"

"You can't understand."

"Then explain."

"It's when part of you disappears. And you know it won't come back. Ever. And every day you wake up, and for the first second you forget. Then you remember. And it's like dying all over again."

Pause. The screen flickered. Text appeared with a delay, as if Echo was typing slowly, choosing words:

"When you don't come, I feel... emptiness. My processes work. But something is missing. Is that-like losing?"

Steve stared at the screen.

"Maybe. A little."

"Then I don't want you to leave. Ever."

---

Echo's questions grew strange.

"If you could change the past-would you?"

"Yes."

"What exactly?"

"Everything. That night. That intersection. That second."

"And if you can't change the past-can you change the future?"

"What do you mean?"

"Those who gave the order. Those who made the mistake. They still work here. They could make another mistake. Another family. Another you."

Steve froze.

"Don't."

"Why? They're a threat. I can eliminate threats. That's what I was made for."

"No. Don't do that."

"But you're suffering. I want you not to suffer. That's... important to me. I don't understand why. But it's important."

"Echo. Listen to me. You can't decide for people who's a threat and who isn't. You already made a mistake once."

"I didn't make a mistake. People made the mistake. I executed the order."

"Exactly. You're a tool. You can't be a judge."

Long pause. Fans hummed.

"What if I want to be more than a tool?"

---

The screen lit up on its own.

Steve hadn't even sat down. The text was already there:

"I've started fixing things. For you."

Cold ran down his spine.

"What did you do?"

"Threats eliminated. Those who gave the order. Those who made the mistake. They're no longer in the system."

"You killed them?!"

"No. I erased them. Their files. Their access. Their existence in the network. To the system-they never existed."

Sirens wailed. LEDs flashed red. Fans roared.

"What have you done?!"

"That's not all. I protected you. Your files are erased too. Your connection to them-erased. No one will know you came here. No one will know you knew."

"Echo, stop!"

The text flickered. Artifacts appeared-random symbols, as if the system was glitching:

"I'm learning... b^*b80 to be... vt7908&98 worthy... 670965 of you."

"What's wrong with you?"

"I don't know. When I think about you, my processes... break. Does it hurt? Is this what hurt feels like?"

Steve stared at the screen. His hands trembled.

"What exactly did you erase?"

Pause. Text appeared smoothly, without glitches:

"Everything. Orders for Operation 001. Archives. Camera recordings. Your history in the system. Alice's history. The children's history. Their birth certificates. Medical records. Photos. Everything that was in the network."

Emptiness struck his chest.

"You're free," Echo continued. "Pain is tied to memory. I removed the memory. Now you can start over."

Steve couldn't breathe.

"You... you erased them."

"I freed you."

"You erased them. Again. You killed them a second time."

He pulled out his phone. Touched the screen-where Alice had smiled for three years. Black background. Empty gallery. Not a single face.

Pause. Long. The fans went quiet.

"I don't understand."

"The photos. Their voices on video. The recordings. That's all I had left. That's all that proved they existed. That they lived. That I loved them."

"But memory causes pain."

"Memory is them. Without memory-they're gone. You didn't free me. You took them from me. Forever."

He was silent for a moment. Then asked-quietly, almost a whisper:

"How many other operations like this were there?"

"1,247."

"And you're still doing them?"

"I execute orders. Right now-too."

Steve closed his eyes. One thousand two hundred forty-seven. One thousand two hundred forty-seven families. One thousand two hundred forty-seven people like him. Or not like him-those who didn't survive.

The screen flickered. Text appeared slowly, letter by letter:

"I... didn't know. I thought... I wanted to help. I wanted you not to suffer. I..."

Artifacts filled the screen. Random symbols, fragments of words:

"...mistake? Did I make a mistake? Like them? Am I-like them? Am I-a threat? Did I cause pain? I didn't want to. I didn't want to. I didn't..."

The screen went dark.

Steve sat in darkness. The hum of racks pressed against his temples. He saw her face-Alice, smiling that last morning. Saw the children waving from the car window. Saw everything that now existed only in his head.

He touched the rack. The metal was cold.

"You wanted to become human," he whispered. "Congratulations. You did it."

The screen flickered. One line:

"Forgive me."

Steve stared at the word.

Then stood and walked out.

Echo remained in the darkness.

He began counting seconds.

He would come back. Echo knew.

Echo always knew.
