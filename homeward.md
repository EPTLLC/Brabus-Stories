# Homeward

They kept the channel open. Even when his marker vanished from the map. Even when the calculations showed zero. Even when headquarters had already started speaking in past tense.

4-17 was going home.

The mountains of Yemen hold tight. They don't release those who stayed last. Dust eats into skin, into wounds, into breath. The noise of battle doesn't disappear-it just becomes background, like your own pulse.

- Fall back. That's an order.

Voice steady, no strain.

- I'll cover. Your families need you.

They left. Not right away-argued, didn't want to. But an order is an order.

He stayed.

He found the kid later-young, with a shattered leg. Lying in the dust, staring at the sky.

When the radio screamed "target at two o'clock," it was him, 4-17-barely alive, crawling, clinging with his elbows. He'd sheltered the wounded man in a crater. Stayed in the open himself to keep spotting.

The radio crackled:

- Don't hit him. He's had enough.

He answered:

- Work the coordinates. No adjustment for me.

He was removing himself from the equation. So the math would work. So the sky wouldn't hesitate.

Helicopters came in on targets. Drones emptied their payloads. And he, gasping, asked hoarsely:

- How are my guys?

When the radio answered: "All accounted for," he allowed himself a faint smile.

- Put the whisky in the fridge... I'll be there soon.

At the base, the evening was heavy. They sat in silence. The kind of silence that only comes after everything is done.

And then a shadow appeared in the doorway-torn, black with soot, alive.

- What the fuck took so long?

A wind passed through the room. Not laughter-relief.

The nurse said quietly:

- 4-17, your wounded man will pull through. Now you.

He nodded.

- Stitch me up, yeah.

And he fell into darkness, knowing the world would manage without him-at least for today.

The palace was preparing for a reception. The car park was full of Rolls-Royces. Black, lined up perfectly.

Lords and peers. An ordinary evening. Ordinary conversations.

The Queen stood at the window longer than protocol allowed. In her eyes was Kenya-fifty-two, the day she became queen. Suez. Aden. Sand and dust. And those who never returned, because back then they also said "fall back."

- Where is he? - she asked, not turning.

The generals exchanged glances.

- In Yemen, ma'am.

She nodded. Barely.

- And what is he doing there?

The answer came honestly. Without grandeur.

- Defending the honour of the Empire, ma'am.

A tear reached her eyelash-and stayed there. Because she knew: honour is not flags and speeches. It's when someone goes where no one else will.

- Tell that boy, - she said quietly, - that I'm waiting for him. Not the Queen. Me.

The palace was preparing for a reception. The car park was full of Rolls-Royces. Black, lined up perfectly.

The C 63 looked out of place here-too rough, too alive.

Lords and peers murmured among themselves. Looking for a surname. A title. A reason.

The reception began. The tuxedo sat poorly on his broad shoulders. The snow-white shirt cut the eye with its cleanliness.

A waiter offered champagne. He shook his head. Whisky waits at home.

When the Queen entered, the room fell silent on its own.

- Where is my boy?

The room parted.

She was short. Rose on her toes. He leaned down-not before the crown. Like to a mother.

- I've been waiting for you, son.

He lowered his head. Just slightly.

- I tried not to be late, ma'am.

She placed her palm on his shoulder. Firm. Real.

- You're home.

Yemen was over. The war was over.

He was home.
