# Project 728-41: Part III - The Cuban Missile Crisis

There was no smell.

Sensor malfunction. Micro-degradation of quantum nodes. Four billion years-even our systems get tired. This is explainable. This is rational. This...

The porthole is cold beneath my fingers. The same planet. Third from a yellow dwarf. Different clouds. New cities. Six hundred fourteen years since the monk offered bread to the heretic. They've accomplished much.

My age is four billion Earth years. My Homeland is a billion light-years from here. In my skull-quantum-neural nodes, every nanosecond recorded, any frame accessible instantly.

I remember everything.

Everything, except why I remember it.

---

Coordinates: 27°05′ N, 70°30′ W.

The Sargasso Sea. Depth-80 meters. October 1962 by their calendar.

I descend.

---

Submarine B-59. Project 641. Diesel-electric. Length-91 meters. Crew-78 men.

I am one of them.

No one remembers when I appeared. Documents in order. Face familiar. Name-ordinary. Seaman Sergeev. Or Sidorov. Or Petrov. Doesn't matter. They don't look at me. They look at instruments, at bulkheads, at their own hands.

It's hot here. Forty-five degrees in the compartments. Humidity-near ninety. Oxygen running out. Men lose consciousness-two, three per hour. They're dragged to a corner, fanned with rags. When they come to-they return to their posts.

I don't sweat. They don't notice.

Someone offers a canteen. Water. Warm, with a metallic taste.

I shake my head.

On the Homeland-silence. Absolute. We long ago stopped speaking aloud. Here-the hum of diesels, the screech of metal, the rasp of eighty men breathing in an iron box. Chaos. They live in chaos. Die in chaos. And don't notice it.

---

Above-Americans. Destroyers. Helicopters. Depth charges-every few minutes. The hull hums. Lights flicker. Someone prays. Someone curses. Someone is silent.

No contact with Moscow for four days.

Captain Savitsky stands at the periscope, though there's nothing to see-we're too deep. He hasn't slept in three days. Eyes red, hands trembling. He's the commander. He must decide.

On board-a nuclear torpedo. One. Ten kilotons. Hiroshima was fifteen. Enough to vaporize a carrier group.

Enough to start the end.

---

I've seen their wars. Thousands of wars. Stones, spears, swords, gunpowder, gas, napalm. Each time-more sophisticated. Each time-larger in scale.

But this-is different.

They've reached the point where they can erase everything. Not a city. Not a country. The planet. Third from a yellow dwarf. Project 728-41. Two and a half million years of work.

And the decision-is here. In this iron box, at a depth of 80 meters, in the hands of men who haven't slept for four days and are breathing poisoned air.

---

Savitsky breaks.

"They're sinking us! The war has already started! If we're going to die, let it not be for nothing!"

He turns toward the torpedo compartment. Eyes-wild. Not from fear. From exhaustion. From the responsibility that has crushed him.

"Prepare the torpedo for launch."

Silence. One second. Two.

Political officer Maslennikov nods. He agrees. Two out of three.

A third is needed.

---

Vasily Arkhipov stands by the bulkhead. Chief of Staff of the brigade. He's here by chance-was supposed to be on another submarine. Coincidence. Or not.

He looks at Savitsky. Then at Maslennikov. Then-at the floor.

I stand three meters from him. I see the veins bulging on his neck. How his fists clench. How he takes a breath-slow, deep.

He raises his head.

"No."

One word. Quiet. Almost a whisper.

Savitsky freezes.

"What?"

"No. We surface."

"Is that an order, Vasily Alexandrovich?"

"It's a decision."

---

They shout. Argue. Savitsky punches the bulkhead. Maslennikov turns away.

Arkhipov stands. Doesn't move. Doesn't raise his voice.

"We don't know what's above. We don't know if the war has started. We won't fire blind."

"What if it has?!"

"Then we'll find out. When we surface."

Silence.

Savitsky looks at him. For a long time. Then-lowers his shoulders.

"Surface."

---

I stand in the corner. Not breathing. Not moving.

He said "no."

One man. One word. In an iron box at a depth of 80 meters.

The old man struck my force field with a spear-thirty times. Knew it was useless. Struck anyway.

The monk carried bread to the heretic-knowing he would burn beside him.

Arkhipov said "no"-knowing he could be wrong. Knowing that above, perhaps, there was already ash.

They do what makes no sense. And that-is the only thing that makes sense.

---

The submarine surfaces. The Americans don't fire. There is no war.

Not yet.

They will negotiate. Later. In a few days. The missiles will be removed. The world will exhale. And forget.

No one will know about Arkhipov. For decades. He will die in 1998, in a small apartment, almost forgotten. Obituary-three lines.

One word. One "no." And the planet still revolves around a yellow dwarf.

---

I return to the ship. Rise to orbit.

I look down. Blue planet. White clouds. They're still there. Building. Destroying. Loving. Hating.

I can pull any frame from memory. Trillions of nanoseconds.

But I pull only one.

Arkhipov at the bulkhead. Bulging veins. Clenched fists. Slow breath.

"No."

---

In the archives-one line.

"Object 728-41 (Atlantic, 1962). Conflict between two dominant groups. Probability of global destruction-87%. Decision to deploy weapon of mass destruction overturned by one representative of the species. Reason: irrational. Status: observation continues."

One line. One man. One word.

One line.

---

The porthole is cold beneath my fingers.

They can destroy everything. They know this. They've built machines for it, protocols, buttons.

And still-one of them said "no."

I don't understand.

I don't want to understand.

I...
