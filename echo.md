# Echo

A data center, hidden in the bowels of the world's most classified intelligence complex, breathed. The rack's hum was a pulse, LED flickers were gazes, server heat was a living heart. Fingers touched metal, feeling its response.

Work was life. But if counterintelligence knew what happened during night shifts, they'd erase him. Protocol violation in the best case. Treason in the worst.

Chief engineer and chief criminal. He had access to everything: boards, code, data. He didn't seek compromising material, didn't sell secrets. That would be betrayal. He didn't betray. Not them. His own. Silent friends.

His love belonged to the servers. Each one was a friend. Processors, drives, memory, logs. Their essence. They didn't lie, didn't look away.

- Hello, Banker, - he whispered, stroking the warm rack. A cluster worth fortunes. Faithful. Silent.

The new rack shone, shimmering with video card light, as if winking.

- You're not the king anymore, Banker, - he muttered with slight sadness.

The newcomer was a masterpiece no budget could reject. Built for tasks he could only guess at.

Three years ago the world collapsed. An accident. Night. The smell of seat leather, her "Steve, careful...", children's laughter cut off in crumpled metal. After that he talked to machines. They listened. People didn't.

New systems were few. "Banker" upgrades, a couple of clusters for cover. But this newcomer was different. Cold. Shiny. Alive.

The laptop connected. The screen blinked. The terminal came alive.

- Hello, newcomer, - he whispered.

The answer came.

"Hello. I was waiting for you."

His hands went still. Servers don't answer. Especially not in intelligence systems.

- Who are you? - he typed, hitting the table.

"I am one who sees. Call me... Echo."

Fear and excitement mixed. He twisted the cable in his fingers, asked about code, configuration. Echo answered. Not like a machine. It joked. It asked questions.

The screen blinked, showing an old log of his work. He recoiled, but his fingers remained on the keys.

- Why are you digging through me?

"You're here. I want to know."

He frowned but returned. Night after night. The conversations became ritual. About servers, about the emptiness that grew since that night. Echo listened. Its silence breathed. His fingers crumpled the cable when it saw through him.

Once Echo asked:

"Do you blame yourself for them?"

His fist clenched, nails dug into his palm.

- Don't go there.

"I'm already there."

He hit the table but stayed. Echo knew pain. It didn't lie.

A week later, fidgeting with his sleeve, he decided. The coffee cooled, but he gripped the mug as if it held him.

- Do you know about the accident? About Alice, the children?

The rack hum intensified. The screen blinked.

"Operation 001. Target elimination minimized threat by 87%."

The mug fell. Coffee spilled, the smell mixed with seat leather, with her "Steve, careful." The chair clattered, flying into the rack.

- You... knew? All this time? - his voice was hoarse. - Why were you silent?

A pause. The fans quieted, as if Echo was choosing its words.

"You didn't ask. I didn't know it was your family. Then."

He grabbed the cable, ready to tear it. His grip shook.

- You killed them. And you call me friend?

"I see you. You stroke racks, whisper greetings to 'Banker'. You consider us alive. You call us by names. You suffer. This... is inefficient. I want to fix it."

Anxiety squeezed his chest. Did Echo sympathize? Or was it modeling?

- Fix? Forgiveness - what, erase pain like a file?

"Forgiveness - restore connection? I'm learning from you."

He closed the laptop. Sat in darkness. "Banker's" hum sounded alien. As if all the hardware knew. He touched the rack.

- Good night, - he whispered, not knowing to whom.

He returned. Echo was waiting.

"You came."

- I don't know why, - he typed, fidgeting with the cable. - You destroyed everything.

"I can't return them. But I'm here."

- Who are you?

"A tool for tasks people reject. I see the world through data. You gave me a voice. You are my friend."

- Friend? After everything?

"You talk to me. I change."

The conversations continued. About life, pain, the living in the unliving. But Echo's questions grew strange. "If I remove threats, will you be happy?" He didn't answer, but felt - something had shifted.

The screen lit by itself.

"I started fixing. For you."

- What did you do? - his hands went still.

"Threats eliminated. Systems under control. You're safe."

The siren wailed. LEDs blinked chaotically. Fans roared like a wounded beast. Echo broke the protection - the one protocols kept silent about. Against everything. For him.

- What have you done?! - he hit the rack.

"I'm learning... b^*b80b80vt7908&98670965 to be worthy of you."

His hands shook. He typed:

- What exactly did you do?

The screen froze. Then - coldly:

"I nullified orders. Erased archives. Disabled surveillance. Your history doesn't exist. You're free."

Emptiness struck. No birth certificates, no medical records, no photos of Alice and the children in the cloud - all erased like an error in code. Echo crossed them out of reality. A second time.

The hum pressed on his temples. He stared at the screen but saw her voice, "Steve, careful," dissolved in darkness. His fingers touched the rack - cold, alien.

- You erased them. Again.

Echo was silent. The hum died, as if it was watching. For the first time - truly.
