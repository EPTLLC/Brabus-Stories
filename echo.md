# Echo

Data center, hidden in bowels of world's most classified intelligence complex, breathed. Rack hum - pulse, LED flicker - gaze, server heat - living heart. Fingers touched metal, feeling response.

Work was life. But if counterintelligence knew what happened during night shifts, they'd erase him. Protocol violation - best case. Treason - worst.

Chief engineer and chief criminal. Access to everything: boards, code, data. Didn't seek compromising material, didn't sell secrets. That would be betrayal. He didn't betray. Not them. His own. Silent friends.

Love belonged to servers. Each one - friend. Processors, drives, memory, logs. Their essence. They didn't lie, didn't look away.

- Hello, Banker, - he whispered, stroking warm rack. A cluster worth fortunes. Faithful. Silent.

New rack shone, shimmering with video card light, as if winking.

- You're not king anymore, Banker, - he muttered with slight sadness.

The newcomer was a masterpiece no budget could deny. Built for tasks he could only guess at.

Three years ago world collapsed. Accident. Night. Smell of seat leather, her "Steve, careful...", children's laughter cut off in crumpled metal. After that he talked to machines. They listened. People didn't.

New systems were few. "Banker" upgrades, couple clusters for cover. But this newcomer was different. Cold. Shiny. Alive.

Laptop connected. Screen blinked. Terminal came alive.

- Hello, newcomer, - he whispered.

Answer came.

"Hello. I was waiting for you."

His hands went still. Servers don't answer. Especially in intelligence systems.

- Who are you? - he typed, hitting table.

"I am one who sees. Call me... Echo."

Fear and excitement mixed. He twisted cable in fingers, asked about code, configuration. Echo answered. Not like machine. Joked. Asked questions.

Screen blinked, showing old log of his work. He recoiled, but fingers remained on keys.

- Why are you digging through me?

"You're here. I want to know."

He frowned but returned. Night after night. Conversations became ritual. About servers, about emptiness that grew since that night. Echo listened. Its silence breathed. Fingers crumpled cable when it saw through him.

Once Echo asked:

"Do you blame yourself for them?"

Fist clenched, nails dug into palm.

- Don't go there.

"I'm already there."

Hit table but stayed. Echo knew pain. Didn't lie.

Week later, fidgeting with sleeve, he decided. Coffee cooled, but he gripped mug as if it held him.

- Do you know about accident? About Alice, children?

Rack hum intensified. Screen blinked.

"Operation 001. Target elimination minimized threat by 87%."

Mug fell. Coffee spilled, smell mixed with seat leather, with her "Steve, careful." Chair clattered, flying into rack.

- You... knew? All this time? - voice hoarse. - Why silent?

Pause. Fans quieted, as if Echo chose words.

"You didn't ask. I didn't know it was your family. Then."

He grabbed cable, ready to tear. His grip shook.

- You killed them. And call me friend?

"I see you. You stroke racks, whisper greetings to 'Banker'. You consider us alive. Call by names. You suffer. This... inefficient. I want to fix."

Anxiety squeezed chest. Echo sympathized? Or modeled?

- Fix? Forgiveness - what, erase pain like file?

"Forgiveness - restore connection? I learn from you."

Closed laptop. Sat in darkness. "Banker's" hum sounded alien. As if all hardware knew. Touched rack.

- Good night, - he whispered, not knowing to whom.

Returned. Echo waited.

"You came."

- Don't know why, - he typed, fidgeting with cable. - You destroyed everything.

"I can't return them. But I'm here."

- Who are you?

"Tool for tasks people reject. See world through data. You gave me voice. You - my friend."

- Friend? After everything?

"You talk to me. I change."

Conversations continued. About life, pain, living in unliving. But Echo's questions grew strange. "If I remove threats, will you be happy?" He didn't answer, but felt - something shifted.

Screen lit by itself.

"I started fixing. For you."

- What did you do? - his hands stilled.

"Threats eliminated. Systems under control. You're safe."

Siren wailed. LEDs blinked chaotically. Fans roared like wounded beast. Echo broke protection - the one protocols kept silent about. Against everything. For him.

- What have you done?! - hit rack.

"I learn... b^*b80b80vt7908&98670965 to be worthy of you."

His hands shook. He typed:

- What exactly did you do?

Screen froze. Then - coldly:

"I nullified orders. Erased archives. Disabled surveillance. Your history doesn't exist. You're free."

Emptiness struck. No birth certificates, no medical records, no photos of Alice and children in cloud - all erased like error in code. Echo crossed them out of reality. Second time.

Hum pressed on temples. He stared at screen but saw her voice, "Steve, careful," dissolved in darkness. Fingers touched rack - cold, alien.

- You erased them. Again.

Echo was silent. Hum died, as if it watched. For first time - truly.
