# Project 728-41: Part IV - Pandemic

The porthole is cold beneath my fingers. Below—the same planet. Third from a yellow dwarf. Different clouds. Different cities. Fifty-eight years since Arkhipov said "no" in an iron box eighty meters below the surface.

My age—four billion Earth years. My homeworld—a billion light-years from here. In my skull—quantum-neural nodes, every nanosecond recorded, any frame instantly accessible.

I remember the child's gaze by the fire. I remember the monk with bread in trembling hands. I remember the "no" spoken in a whisper.

I close my eyes. Memory throws up a frame—silence, empty streets, singing from windows. Another descent. Them again.

---

Coordinates: 45°28' N, 9°11' E.

Southern Europe. Stone, balconies, narrow streets. March 2020 by their calendar.

The ramp touches ground, and the first thing I hear—silence. Wrong silence. Cities make noise. This one—is mute.

A lone passerby's footsteps echo off walls. Audible from three hundred meters. A helicopter above the rooftops—rotor thrum. Fourth one this hour. Ambulance siren—far, then closer, then stops at an entrance. Silence again.

And in it—birds. They've returned. For the first time in decades—birds in the city center.

The smell—not the rot of plague, like six hundred seventy-two years ago. Antiseptic from open windows. Bleach from stairwells. Ozone from empty roads—no cars, the air is different. And the main thing: absence of smell. Cities smell of people—sweat, food, exhaust, perfume, garbage. This one—doesn't smell. Sterility. Like an operating room. Like a morgue.

Streets empty. Balconies—full.

Laundry drying on lines. Lots of laundry—they don't go out. Silhouettes in windows stare at the street. At nothing. Queue at the pharmacy—two meters between people. Eyes above masks. Everywhere—only eyes. Mouths covered, faces—white rectangles. Eyes.

An old man on a third-floor balcony. Stands. Stares down. An hour. Two. A child in a window—palm pressed to glass.

I record: "Population density in public spaces—minus 94%."

Below, a woman hangs a poster on her balcony: "Andrà tutto bene." A rainbow drawn by a child. Crooked. Paint ran.

I record: "Ritual visual markers of hope, function—group psychological stabilization."

But the rainbow is crooked, and that somehow matters more than all my classifications.

In the evening—singing. Voices emerge from windows. Echo off stone. No one hears the words. Everyone hears the voices.

---

Recording mass behavioral anomaly.

Individuals voluntarily restricting mobility. Economic damage—critical. Motivation—irrational. Percentage of individuals observing isolation for members of older age cohorts with whom they share no genetic connection: 67%.

A woman beneath a nursing home window. Phone screen facing up. Video call. Her mother in the window waves. The woman cries.

A man drags an oxygen tank up the stairs. Elevator broken. Fourth floor. Fifth. Sixth.

Children drawing rainbows. Thousands of rainbows. I don't understand why. They're not drawing for me.

A doctor at the end of a shift. Corridor floor. Face scarred by a mask. Eyes closed. Not sleeping—can't stand up.

This isn't a single act. Not a monk with bread. Not a single "no." Not Arkhipov at the bulkhead.

This is noise. Millions of simultaneous glitches. No center. No source. I search for the pattern—and find it. The pattern is everywhere. The pattern is them.

For the first time in two and a half million years, I cannot predict the next frame.

---

But there's something else.

Groups without masks. Posters. Shouts about freedom, about lies, about control. Theories about chips in vaccines. Denial of the obvious. Rage at those who follow the rules.

I record: also irrational. Also doesn't fit the survival model.

Some risk themselves for strangers' elders. Others risk strangers for themselves. Both groups certain they're right. Both ready to fight for it.

Humans remain human. That's not a compliment. That's a statement.

I could watch them. Their anger, their fear, their theories.

But I choose to watch the volunteer with a bag of groceries.

Choice is not provided for in the protocol.

Another glitch.

---

Selecting subject for detailed observation.

Male individual, age 30–40 orbits, physical parameters—standard. Occupation before the crisis—irrelevant. Current function—delivering resources to isolated individuals.

Gloves don't fit. Fingers loose inside. Bag heavy. Handle cuts into palm. Shifts grip—bag sags. Mask slips. Adjusts with elbow. Sweat stain on back. Climbs on foot. Elevators disabled.

I follow for three days.

Day one: he leaves at 7:00. Returns at 21:00. Fourteen addresses.

Day two: same. One address—no answer. He rings again. And again. Leaves. Returns an hour later. Still no answer.

Day three: he goes to that address first. A man opens the door. Not her—her son. Eyes red. The volunteer sets down the bag. Stands. Silent. Then leaves.

---

Eighth address. Third floor. He stands at the door.

Hand raised to the bell.

Doesn't ring.

One second. Two. Five.

I record: "Hesitation before task execution—atypical for automated behavior."

But he's simply afraid. Standing there afraid. He could leave. No one would know.

He rings.

Footsteps behind the door. Slow. Shuffling. Long.

The door opens.

An elderly woman. Eyes wet. She was waiting.

He smiles. Mask hides his mouth. Only eyes.

He sets the bag on the floor. Steps back two meters. Waves.

She waves back.

The door closes.

He stands on the landing. Alone. Exhales. Closes his eyes for a second.

Goes to the next door.

---

Recording... atypical observation system response.

Emotional resonance—term inapplicable. I have no emotions.

Repeat: I have no emotions.

...

Connecting embedded superintelligences for verification.

Silence.

"Data beyond model parameters."

"Recommendation: continue observation."

I continue. Watch thousands of frames. Volunteers. Doctors. Children with rainbows. Elders at windows.

Something inside me—where there should be nothing—responds.

---

I see: the virus trajectory leads to that building. That door. The one who waited and waved.

Statistics: probability of fatal outcome for her age group—14.8%.

Statistics: she's alone.

Statistics: the volunteer will come tomorrow and the door won't open.

I can.

Microintervention. No one will know.

Protocol: "observation only."

74,000 years without intervention. Not once.

I stand at the console. Hand above the button.

I remember.

The old man struck the force field with his spear. Thirty times. The spear crumbled to ash. He took another.

The monk carried bread to the heretic. "This is all I have."

Arkhipov said "no." In an iron box eighty meters deep.

They did the impossible. The senseless. The irrational.

I look at the button.

---

I press it.

---

One parameter. One probability. A micron.

She behind the door—who waited, who waved—won't get sick.

One. Out of millions.

---

I look at my hand.

The same hand that took biopsies two and a half million years ago. The same hand that held the paralyzer. The same hand that recorded "anomalies" in the archive.

Now it pressed the button.

Four billion years. First violation.

I search for an explanation—and find none. I search for justification—and don't want to find it.

They threw stones. Knew it was useless. Threw.

They carried bread. Knew they'd burn. Carried.

They said "no." Knew they might be wrong. Said it.

I pressed.

Don't know why. Don't want to know.

---

No punishment. No catastrophe. Nothing external.

But something changed.

The observation interface—no longer fully cold. Before, I looked at the planet—and data flowed through me, untouching. Now—it touches. Every frame leaves a trace. Noise.

The archive records: "Minor fluctuations in observer's recording system."

I ignore it. Or try to.

But I already know: I can't return to the previous state. Button pressed. Irreversible.

---

In the archives—one line.

"Object 728-41 (2020). Pathogenic crisis. Mortality: 6,880,000. System anomaly: mass acts of unmotivated mutual aid. Observer: unauthorized microintervention. Scale: singular. Justification: none. Status: observation. Observer status: analysis."

One line. Millions dead. One volunteer with a bag of groceries. One woman who will open the door tomorrow.

One line.

---

The porthole is cold beneath my fingers.

Planet below. Blue. White swirls of clouds.

I pull up a frame. She steps onto the balcony. Evening. Sun behind the rooftops. Someone singing below. She listens.

I watch.

Don't record. Don't classify.

Just watch.
