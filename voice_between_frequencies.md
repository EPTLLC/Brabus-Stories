# Voice Between Frequencies

The room was cramped. The ceiling pressed down on his shoulders, the walls smelled of dampness and something burnt—maybe coffee, maybe something else. The window, crusted with grime, let in murky light. Beyond it—a field strewn with gravel, and further—fog. Dense as milk. Sometimes he thought he saw shapes in it—houses? towers?—but one blink and they vanished.

He didn't remember how he got here.

Didn't remember the road. Didn't remember what came before. Sometimes something surfaced—a blurred platform, someone's voices, a red mitten on wet asphalt—but it broke off before becoming a memory. The mitten. A child's. He didn't know why it kept coming back. He simply found himself here. With this table. With this chair. With this radio.

The receiver sat in the middle of the table—old, with a cracked case and a crooked antenna. A dusty cord hung from the table and ended in nothing. Not cut—just ended. As if the radio lived on its own.

He sat, smoked, flicked ash into a cracked plate. Fingers yellow from nicotine. There was nothing to do but smoke and turn the dial.

The receiver had been silent for a week.

---

And then the radio spoke.

First—a rustle. Like wind through dry leaves. Then—a voice. Low, calm, without gender or age. It spoke slowly, as if tasting the words.

"You didn't sleep last night."

He froze. The cigarette smoldered, ash falling on the table.

"You lay there. Stared at the ceiling. Tried to remember. What exactly?"

The voice came from everywhere—from the walls, from the air, from within himself. He leaned toward the receiver. The needle was frozen between frequencies, in the void.

"Who are you?"

The voice didn't answer. Instead:

"A name. You almost remembered it yesterday. Repeat... repeat... Whose?"

He flinched. Something flickered—a child's voice, "M..."—and cut off. He didn't know whose name. Didn't know if there even was one.

"Shut up."

He reached for the dial. Turned it. Click. Silence.

One second. Two. Three.

"Do you remember the smell?"

The radio was speaking. The dial was set to "off."

"Not gasoline. Something else. Flowers? Perfume? You can almost smell it. Almost."

He grabbed the receiver, hurled it at the wall. The case cracked, the antenna flew off. He stood there, breathing heavily.

Silence.

He turned around. The receiver sat on the table. Intact. Antenna in place. Cord hanging, ending in nothing.

"Interference on the line," said the voice. "But I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you. Stay on frequency."

---

He tried not to listen.

Plugged his ears—the voice sounded inside. Left the room—the door led back to the room. Screamed—the voice waited until he was out of breath, then continued.

"You checked the lock. Yesterday. The day before. Why? Are you afraid someone will come in? Or that you'll go out?"

He sat on the floor, back against the wall. Cigarettes were gone. Or not gone—the pack lay on the table, but he couldn't make himself get up.

"The mirror. In the corner. Under the cloth. You avoid it."

He didn't look at the corner. Didn't look.

"But you did look. Three days ago. Remember what you saw?"

He remembered. Didn't want to remember, but remembered. The reflection was wrong. Not his face—someone else's. Or his, but different. Younger? Older? He didn't have time to understand—turned away, covered the mirror with the cloth.

"Whose face was that?"

"Mine."

"Are you sure?"

He didn't answer.

---

Days blurred together.

Or not days—he didn't know. The light beyond the window never changed, always the same murky gray. The fog thickened, crept toward the glass. Sometimes it seemed like it was already inside—in the corners, under the ceiling, in his lungs.

The voice spoke. Not always—sometimes it was silent for hours. But when it spoke, it knew too much.

"You're left-handed. But you write with your right. Why?"

He looked at his hands. Didn't remember.

"The scar on your wrist. Where from?"

He looked. A thin white line. Didn't remember.

"You're afraid of water. Can't look at it. Why? Repeat... why?"

He closed his eyes. Something flickered—dark, cold, small hands beneath the water, a red mitten drifting into blackness—and vanished.

"Enough."

"I can tell you. Everything. Who you are. Where you came from. What you did. Stay on frequency."

"I don't want to."

"You're lying."

He was lying.

---

Once he asked:

"What do you want?"

Pause. Long. The voice seemed to think.

"Nothing."

"Then why?"

"Because you listen."

"I don't want to listen."

"But you do. Every time. You could not turn the dial. Could sit in silence. But you turn it. Why?"

He didn't answer. He knew why. Silence was worse. In silence he heard something else—not the voice from the radio, but something inside. A whisper that was both his own and someone else's.

"You're not afraid of me. You're afraid of what you'll hear when I go silent."

---

He approached the mirror.

The cloth hung in place—dirty, damp. He stood before it, hand raised, fingers an inch from the fabric.

"I wouldn't advise it," said the voice. "But you won't listen."

He yanked off the cloth.

The mirror was empty. The room reflected—table, chair, receiver—but he wasn't there. He stood before the mirror and cast no reflection.

And then he saw.

A shadow. In the corner of the reflected room. It moved—slowly, smoothly. Coming closer. He turned around—no one. Looked in the mirror—the shadow closer. Closer still.

He recoiled, stumbled, fell. The mirror stared at him. The shadow stood in the center of the reflection. Where he should have been.

"Recognize it?" asked the voice.

He recognized it. Not the face—there was no face. But something inside recognized. Something that remembered more than he did.

---

He sat on the floor. Back to the mirror. Didn't turn around.

The radio was silent. He didn't turn the dial. Didn't smoke. Just sat.

The fog beyond the window had become a wall. There was no more light—only gray, even, dead.

He raised his hand. Looked at the scar. A thin white line.

Something flickered. Water. Cold. Small fingers clutching his hand. A name—"M..."—and a splash. And silence.

"Did you remember? Repeat... did you remember?"

He didn't answer.

"You can remember everything. If you want. I'll show you."

"No."

"Why?"

He was silent. Then said—quietly, almost a whisper:

"Because then it will become true. And I'll know whose hands those were. Mine or..."

He didn't finish.

"Or whose?" asked the voice. "You know. You've always known."

He didn't answer.

He stood. Walked to the table. Sat in the chair. Placed his hand on the receiver. Fingers touched the dial.

Didn't turn it.

Sat like that—a minute, an hour, an eternity. Hand on the dial. Eyes closed.

The voice waited.

He knew: turn it—and the voice would return. Tell him. Show him. Take what was left.

He didn't turn it.

But he didn't remove his hand either.

The fog beyond the window breathed. The mirror watched his back. The radio was silent.

For now.
