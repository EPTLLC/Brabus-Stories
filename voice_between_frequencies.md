# Voice Between Frequencies

The room was cramped, with ceiling pressing on shoulders, soaked with dampness and smell of burnt coffee. Dust-caked window bled murky light across chipped linoleum. In corner - table, cluttered with empty tea cans and crumpled cigarette butts. In middle of table stood radio receiver - old, with cracked case, with antenna crooked like finger pointing nowhere.

He sat on wobbly chair, smoked, flicking ash into cracked plate. Outside window - emptiness. Field scattered with gravel, and beyond - wall of fog, dense as condensed milk. Where was this place? He didn't ask. Didn't want to know. Just found himself here - with this table, this radio, this chair. Nothing to do except smoke and turn dial.

Receiver had been silent for week. No noise, no voices, no static - only silence, as if world outside was turned off. He turned dial out of habit, without hope. Fingers, yellow from nicotine, slid across worn plastic. Needle trembled, but sound wasn't born. He inhaled, released smoke, leaned back. Eyes half-closed. Silence.

And then radio spoke.

First - rustle, like wind through dry leaves. Then - voice. Calm, low, without gender or age. It spoke slowly, as if tasting words.

- You didn't sleep last night. Lay, stared at ceiling. Thought about what you lost. About what?

He froze. Cigarette smoldered, ash fell on table. Voice was quiet but poured from everywhere - from walls, from air. He leaned toward receiver, peering into murky scale. Needle froze between frequencies, in emptiness. He touched dial - voice didn't waver.

- It doesn't matter, - voice continued. - Lost or not. But you feel, don't you? Something's wrong. Something slips away.

He coughed, stubbed out cigarette, reached for new one. Hands trembled, but he forced himself to light up, inhale. Voice waited. Didn't rush.

- You checked lock. Yesterday. Day before. Twice. Why? Nobody here. Or is there?

He stood, approached door. Handle cold as ice. Lock in place, locked. He pulled - no use. Returned, sat. Voice didn't stop.

- You avoid mirror. The one in corner, under cloth. But yesterday you looked. Long time. What did you see? Not yourself, right?

Cold gnawed his bones, sweat glazed his forehead. Mirror stood in corner, covered with old fabric. He hadn't touched it. Hadn't looked. Or had he? Memory tangled like shadows in fog. Voice fell silent, pause stretched, pressed.

- Nothing scary, - it said finally. - These are just thoughts. They come. They go. But you know they're not yours. Whose then?

He hit table. Cans clinked, plate with ash overturned. Ash scattered like dust. Voice didn't stop.

- You can turn me off. Turn dial. Break radio. It's just thing. But you won't do it. Why?

He stared at receiver. Hand reached for dial, froze. Voice knew. He wouldn't turn off. Wouldn't break. Couldn't.

- I'll stay, - voice said. - Tomorrow. Day after. When you want to listen. And you will want to.

Rustle. Silence. Radio fell silent. Needle froze. He sat, staring at antenna, at crack in case. Cigarette burned out, burned fingers. He didn't notice.

Outside fog thickened. Room smelled of dampness. He reached for pack, but stopped. Stood, approached mirror. Cloth hung in place. He raised hand, froze. Fingers touched fabric, and it slipped, fell to floor.

In mirror was no reflection. Only room - table, chair, receiver. And shadow. Not his shadow. It moved, slowly, as if someone stood behind. He turned - nobody. Heart pounded, throat tightened. He returned to table, collapsed on chair. Hand reached for receiver, fingers turned dial.

Silence.

But in silence - rustle. Barely audible, like breathing. He closed eyes. Voice didn't return, but he knew: it's here. In walls. In mirror. In him. He no longer checked lock. Didn't look out window. Didn't take cigarettes. Only the dial remained, day after day, until the fog swallowed even the light.
