# Gift of the Sea

Waves rolled onto the shore—slowly, as if the sea was tired from the day. A girl of about ten sat on the sand, her bare feet buried in the warm grains. Blonde hair kept falling into her eyes; she brushed it away absently, her gaze fixed on the horizon. Out there, far away, sky and water became one.

Something dark bobbed in the shallows. Masha squinted. A wave pushed the object onto the sand, retreated, left it lying there.

She ran over, crouched down. A small box. Covered in seaweed and tiny barnacles. Masha picked it up, shook off the sand. Her fingers found the clasp. Inside—nothing. It smelled of salt and something old, forgotten.

Masha turned the box over in her hands. Empty. Boring. She was about to throw it back into the water, but stopped. Grandmother collects things like this. Old buttons, postcards with torn corners, keys to unknown locks. "It's not junk," she always says. "It's someone's life."

Masha slipped the box into her jacket pocket and ran home.

The cottage stood deep in the garden, almost invisible behind the dahlias and hollyhocks. Anna Petrovna straightened up from the flower bed, rubbed her lower back. Hands covered in soil, knees aching, but still—it felt good. She hummed something wordless—a melody she remembered from childhood, though she'd forgotten where it came from.

"Grandmother!"

The voice flew across the garden, ahead of Masha herself. Anna Petrovna smiled, wiped her hands on her apron.

Her granddaughter burst through the gate—braid disheveled, cheeks flushed, eyes shining.

"The sea! A gift! For you!"

Anna Petrovna hugged her, kissed the top of her head that smelled of sun and salt.

"Well, show me."

Masha pulled out the box, held it out on her palms like something fragile.

"I was sitting on the beach, and it just—whoosh!—washes up. Right at my feet. I opened it—empty. But it's beautiful, isn't it?"

Anna Petrovna took the box. The smile still lingered on her lips when her fingers touched the carving on the lid. Three intertwined leaves. Oak, maple, birch.

The smile faded.

She stood motionless. Her fingers slowly scraped away the seaweed, revealing the darkened wood. Masha shifted from foot to foot.

"Grandmother?"

Silence.

Anna Petrovna saw something else. A kitchen with a low ceiling. Light from a kerosene lamp. Her mother's hands, holding out this very box—back then it was light-colored, smelling of varnish. "Keep your dreams in it, Anechka. Or secrets. Or just whatever is dear to you."

Sixteen years old. A chain with a pendant—a tiny silver fish—lay inside on the velvet lining. Her mother's gift. Her mother's last gift—a month later, she was gone.

And then the storm. August, she was twenty-three, young and foolish, went to the sea with friends. The box sat on the windowsill of their rented room. Wind blew the window open at night. By morning, the box was gone. Only wet tracks on the floor, leading to the cliff's edge.

Sixty years.

"Grandmother, are you crying?"

Anna Petrovna blinked. The world returned—dahlias, hollyhocks, her granddaughter with frightened eyes.

"No," she said, and felt a tear roll down her cheek. "Yes. A little."

She lowered herself to her knees right there in the grass, to be face to face with Masha.

"My mother gave me this box. Long ago. When I was a little older than you. And then I lost it. The sea took it."

Masha stared, mouth slightly open.

"And brought it back? After all these years?"

"After all these years."

Masha carefully touched the box.

"What was inside?"

Anna Petrovna was quiet for a moment.

"A fish. Silver, on a chain. My mother's."

"Too bad it's not there."

"Yes," said Anna Petrovna. And suddenly smiled. "Or maybe not. Maybe the fish swam away. It is a fish, after all."

Masha laughed—hesitantly at first, then louder. Anna Petrovna hugged her, held her close.

"Thank you, Masha. This is the best gift. The very best."

---

That evening they sat on the veranda. Tea grew cold in their cups. The box stood between them on the table, and the setting sun fell on the carved leaves, making them almost alive.

Masha swung her legs, feet not reaching the floor.

"Grandmother, what will you put in it now?"

Anna Petrovna looked at the sea, darkening beyond the garden.

"Letters," she said. "To you. I'll write them, and you'll read them later. When you grow up. Or when I'm gone. Whenever you want."

Masha frowned.

"Don't talk about 'gone.'"

"I have to," Anna Petrovna said gently. "It's not scary. It's just the truth."

Masha was quiet, looking at the box.

"Will the sea bring something else?"

"I don't know. Maybe. For those who know how to wait."

They sat in silence until the sun sank below the horizon. The sea darkened, merging with the sky. Somewhere out there, in the depths, a silver fish swam through sixty years—or didn't swim, what difference did it make.

The box had returned.

The rest is just stories we tell ourselves so it won't be so quiet.
