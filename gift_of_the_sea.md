# Gift of the Sea

Waves lazily rolled onto shore, whispering their eternal stories. On the sand, bare feet warmed by sun, sat a girl about ten years old. Her blonde hair was gently stirred by sea breeze, and her gaze wandered along the horizon where sky merged with water. Suddenly her attention was caught by something dark, swaying in shallow water. An object thrown by the sea gently nudged the sand. The girl, burning with curiosity, jumped up and ran to the find.

It was a small box, weathered by decades, with a faded pattern barely visible under a layer of seaweed and tiny mollusks. The girl carefully picked it up, shaking off sand. Fingers found a latch, and holding her breath, she opened the lid. Before her was a jewelry box - old but still elegant. To the girl's disappointment, inside was empty. No sparkling treasures, no mysterious letters - only the smell of sea and dampness. She was about to throw away the find, but suddenly stopped. "Grandmother loves such things," - thought the girl, and smiling, slipped the box into the pocket of her light jacket.

The scene changed: a small but well-kept house was drowning in flowers. In front of it, in the garden, a sturdy elderly woman was bustling. Her hands, used to work, skillfully weeded beds, and her face, framed by gray strands, glowed with calm energy. This was the girl's grandmother, Anna Petrovna, for whom every day was a reason to decorate her small world. She hummed an old song when suddenly she heard a familiar ringing voice: "Grandmother! Grandmother! The sea brought you a gift!"

Anna Petrovna straightened, brushed off her hands and, smiling, hurried to the gate. On the dusty road appeared her granddaughter, Masha, with disheveled braid and shining eyes. The girl rushed to grandmother, and she hugged her tightly, laughing and kissing the top of her head. "Well, what kind of gift, Masha?" - she asked, and the granddaughter, wasting no time, pulled the box from her pocket. "Imagine, grandmother, I'm sitting by the sea, and it - bam! - brings out this!"

Grandmother took the box, still smiling, but her gaze suddenly froze. Fingers slowly traced the familiar pattern, wiping away seaweed remains. Time seemed to stop. Before Anna Petrovna's eyes flashed memories: her sixteenth birthday, mother extending this very box with a warm smile, words: "Keep your dreams in it, Anechka." Then the box was new, shiny, and in it lay a thin chain with pendant - a gift that Anna Petrovna lost many years ago, along with the box itself, carried away by a wave during a storm.

"Grandmother, what's wrong?" - Masha's voice brought her back to reality. Anna Petrovna blinked, chasing away tears, and pressed her granddaughter close. "This isn't just a box, Masha, - she said quietly. - This is memory. My mother gave it to me when I was little older than you. And the sea... the sea returned it to me after so many years." She stroked the girl's head, then added: "Thank you, my dear. This is the best gift."

They entered the house together. Masha chattered about the sea, about how she found the box, and Anna Petrovna listened, holding her hand. At sunset they sat on the veranda, sipping herbal tea, and the box stood on the table, as if connecting past and present. Anna Petrovna decided that now it would store letters she would write for Masha - so that someday, years later, her granddaughter could also touch memory.

The sea outside the window continued its eternal dance, whispering new stories. And somewhere in its depths, perhaps, the next gift was already waiting - for those who still believe the sea can return what time once stole.
